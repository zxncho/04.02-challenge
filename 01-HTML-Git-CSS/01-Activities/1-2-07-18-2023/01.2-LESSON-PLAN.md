# 01.2 Weekday Lesson Plan: Introduction to HTML and CSS

## Overview

In today's class, students will be introduced to HTML and CSS, the fundamental technologies used to structure and style a webpage. Students will also learn about web accessibility and semantic HTML tags.

## Instructor Notes

* **Important**: Students will receive access to the GitHub Student Developer Pack in Week 8 of the course through an email invitation at the email address they have on file with the boot camp. The Developer Pack provides them with $13 in free Heroku credits each month, which they'll need to complete several of the Challenge assignments and projects in the second half of the course.

  * To ensure that your students receive this invitation and that it doesn't get sent to spam, please ask them to add `fs-ground_bootcamp@edx.org` to the their list of contacts with the email address they have on file with the boot camp.

  * If students need guidance on how to add a contact to their contacts, please provide them with the links below:
  
    * [Gmail guide](https://support.google.com/contacts/answer/1069522?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop)

    * [Outlook guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-a-contact-in-outlook-1ef8f35b-04be-4bd0-ac9c-6d6a146887ce#:~:text=Add%20a%20contact%20from%20an,Select%20Save%20%26%20Close.)

    * [Yahoo! guide](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN28059.html)

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `05-Ins_HTML` through `14-Stu_CSS-Selectors`.

* HTML and CSS can be overwhelming for new developers. Encourage students to google HTML and CSS syntax to reinforce the classroom learning as needed.

* During activities, encourage students to refer to the provided user stories and acceptance criteria&mdash;as introduced in the previous class&mdash;to identify the user's goal and the conditions that must be met for the solution to be accepted. Doing so will help reinforce their computational thinking skills and set them up for success in future coding challenges.

* If students do not have the required tools set up on their local machines, refer them to office hours for assistance. A list of required tools and resources can be found in the [01.1 Lesson Plan](../01-Day_Intro-Git/01.1-LESSON-PLAN.md).

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this module for those who want to further their knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Add structure and content to a webpage using HTML elements.

* Add attributes to configure or adjust behavior of specific elements.

* Add custom color and fonts to a webpage using CSS properties.

* Select an HTML element to style using CSS selectors.

* Link a CSS style sheet to an HTML file.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Inform the students that today they will take their first steps in web development by learning to use HTML and CSS to structure and style a webpage&mdash;but first, they will learn about an important tool of communication: a readme file.

* Explain that developers must be able to clearly communicate information in a readable format. One tool that we can use for this purpose is a **readme** file.

* Note that each activity in this course provides a readme file that includes a user story, acceptance criteria, and information about the task. The readme file is the first place students should look when starting an activity.

* In addition, we can use a readme file to provide other developers with information about the completed solution and the problem that it solves.

* Emphasize that for each project in this course, students will be required to write a readme that describes why they built the project, what problem it solves, and what they learned in developing a solution.

* A readme file can also help convey how the user goal identified in the user story and the acceptance criteria are clearly met by your solution.

* Open the [Professional README Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * While there is not a single right approach, this template provides an excellent guide to the information typically conveyed in a project readme.

  * Note that this resource is available in this week's Challenge folder.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we use a readme file to communicate with other developers?

  * 🙋 A readme file conveys key information to other developers. For example, for each activity in this course, a readme file provides the information needed to complete the task. Project readme files explain why the project was built, the problem that was solved, and what was learned in the process.

* Transition to the next activity by reminding the students that each day's activities&mdash;including the readme file with information on how to complete the task&mdash;are found in the class repository and should be downloaded by performing a `git pull` before class.

### 2. Instructor Demo: HTML (5 min)

* Open `05-Ins_HTML/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 HTML is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure your page.

  * 🔑 HTML comprises various elements that provide structure and content.

  * Some common HTML elements include section headings, images, paragraphs, unordered lists, and links.

* Open `05-Ins_HTML/index.html` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * We start every HTML document with a **document declaration**, which tells the browser that the content should be read as HTML:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    ```

  * 🔑 We begin and end an HTML document with an `<html>` element.

  * 🔑 The `<head>` element contains metadata. The content inside the `<head>` element is not displayed on the page:

    ```html
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <title>Hello HTML!</title>
    </head>
    ```

  * 🔑 The `<body>` element contains all the content visible on the page.

  * Inside the `<body>` element, we define the different parts of a webpage using semantic elements like `<header>` and `<section>`. Semantic elements help make the code more readable and accessible.

  * HTML also includes a number of elements to display content like text and images on the page.

  * Section heading elements are used for headings or subheadings on your page. The `<h1>` element is reserved for the main title or heading, and the `<h6>` is used for the lowest-level subheading:

    ```html
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <h2>Hello World!</h2>
    <h3>Hello World!</h3>
    <h4>Hello World!</h4>
    <h5>Hello World!</h5>
    <h6>Hello World!</h6>
    ```

  * We use an `<img>` element for images. Inside the `<img>` element, we specify a path to the image:

    ```html
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/200" alt="placeholder image"/>
    ```

  * We use a paragraph element (`<p>`) to contain text:

    ```html
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    ```

  * A `<strong>` element marks important content. Text inside the `<strong>` element will be bolded:

    ```html
    <strong>BOLDED TEXT</strong>.
    ```

  * The `<ul>` element represents an unordered list of items:

    ```html
    <ul>
        <li>This is list item one</li>
        <li>This is list item two</li>
        <li>This is list item three</li>
    </ul>
    ```

  * The `<a>` element defines a link. Inside the `<a>` element, we specify the link's destination:

    ```html
    <a href="https://www.google.com">This is a link to Google.com</a>
    ```

  * Comments can make your code easier to read and are not visible to the user! To make a comment in HTML, we use the following format:

    ```html
    <!-- Headers -->
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we build a webpage using HTML elements?

  * 🙋 HTML elements are the building blocks of a webpage. They define the different parts of the page and provide structure as well as visible content.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `06-Stu_HTML/README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: HTML (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `06-Stu_HTML/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Create a Webpage Using HTML

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a student, I want to create a biography page that includes an image, a paragraph about me, and my contact information.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when the main header reads "Student Bio".

  * It's done when there is a section that includes a name, an image, and a paragraph.

  * It's done when there is a second section that includes a subheader labeled "Contact Info" and a list that includes links to my email, GitHub, and portfolio.

  * It's done when the finished page matches the mockup.

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![Webpage titled "Student Bio" features "Your Name" heading, a spot for an image and bio, and a "Contact Info" section.](./assets/image-1.png)

  You can use this [placeholder image](https://via.placeholder.com/200).

  ---

  ## 💡 Hints

  How can you use header elements to define the most important heading and the subheaders? How will using different header elements impact the size of the text?

  Refer to the [Full-Stack Blog HTML Cheatsheet](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/html/html-cheatsheet)

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What are the advantages of using semantic elements in your HTML?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: HTML (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with HTML? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `<body>`

  * ✔️ `<header>`

  * ✔️ `<h1>` through `<h6>`

  * ✔️ `<img>`

  * ✔️ `<ul>`

  * ✔️ `<a>`

* Open `06-Stu_HTML/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We place all the visible content inside the `<body>` element.

  * 🔑 We use a semantic `<header>` element to define the area of the website that is used as the header. While not visible on their own, **semantic** elements make the structure of your webpage easily readable by the browser, as well as accessible.

  * 🔑 We add the content of the main heading in an `<h1>` element:

    ```html
    <header>
      <h1>Student Bio</h1>
    </header>
    ```

  * We use the semantic element `<section>` to define the two sections of the webpage.

  * Within each section, we will add heading elements. For the purpose of accessibility, it is important not to skip heading levels&mdash;so we will use `<h2>` for the section headings because we used `<h1>` for the main heading:

    ```html
    <h2>Your Name</h2>
    ```

  * 🔑 To add an image to the bio section, we will include an `<img>` element, using `src` to specify the path to the image:

    ```html
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/200" alt="Your Name">
    ```

  * We can use a `<p>` element to add a paragraph of text to the webpage:

    ```html
    <p>Write a short paragraph or two about yourself</p>
    ```

  * 🔑 The `<ul>` element allows us to create an unordered list:

    ```html
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="#">someplace@gmail.com</a></li>
      <li><strong>Github:</strong> <a href="#">sampleName</a></li>
      <li><strong>Portfolio:</strong> <a href="#">coming soon</a></li>
    </ul>
    ```

  * 🔑 We can use the `<a>` element to add a link to the list items in the preceding example. Inside this element, we specify the link's destination:

    ```html
    <a href="#">someplace@gmail.com</a>
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we add structure to a webpage?

  * 🙋 We use semantic elements to define different areas of the webpage.

  * ☝️ How do we add content to a webpage?

  * 🙋 We use HTML elements to add content like images, headings, and lists to the page.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on HTML elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) and the [MDN Web Docs on HTML as a good basis for accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Attributes (5 min)

* Open `07-Ins_Attributes/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * We use **attributes** to configure or adjust the behavior of specific elements.

  * Attributes are commonly used with link and image elements to provide important information.

  * We also use **global attributes** to identify elements for styling.

* Open `07-Ins_Attributes/index.html` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * We include the `src` attribute with an image element to specify the image's absolute or relative path:

    ```html
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/200" alt="placeholder image"/>
    <img src="./assets/images/sample.jpg" alt="placeholder image"/>
    ```

  * Each image should also include an `alt` attribute. An `alt` attribute provides text that describes the image. This attribute makes your image accessible to users who cannot see it or use assistive technologies to browse the web:

    ```html
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/200" alt="placeholder image"/>
    ```

  * Within an `<a>` element, we use an `href` attribute to specify the URL of the page we want to link to:

    ```html
    <a href="https://www.google.com">This is a link to Google.com</a>
    ```

  * Now let's set up the HTML document to use CSS so that we can apply the rules written in the style sheet to the webpage. A **style sheet** is a list of CSS properties that defines how HTML elements will be displayed.

  * We will add a `<link>` element to connect the HTML page to an external CSS style sheet. Within that element, the `href` attribute specifies the relative path, and the `rel` attribute describes the relationship:

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css">
    ```

  * Global attributes can be used on any element. They are often used to identify elements and set up the HTML elements for styling.

  * A `class` attribute can be used to select and style one or more elements:

    ```html
    <section class="lesson">
    ```

  * The `id` attribute is used to select a single element for styling:

    ```html
    <p id="paragraph-1">Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.</p>
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why do we add attributes to HTML elements?

  * 🙋 We add attributes to elements to provide additional information, identify the elements, and configure or adjust the behavior of specific elements.

  * ☝️ How do we use attributes to set up the HTML page so that we can apply CSS styling?

  * 🙋 We use the `<link>` element with an `href` attribute to connect the CSS to the HTML page. We use the `id` and `class` attributes to identify elements for styling.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `08-Stu_Attributes/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: Attributes (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `08-Stu_Attributes/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Add Global Attributes to HTML Elements for Use With CSS

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to add global attributes to my HTML elements so that I can add styling with CSS.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when the `<section>` elements are given a class attribute with a value of `lesson`.

  * It's done when the email list item is given a unique identifier attribute with a value of `email`.

  * It's done when the GitHub list item is given a unique identifier attribute with a value of `github`.

  * It's done when the portfolio list item is given a unique identifier attribute with a value of `portfolio`.

  * It's done when the existing image's `src` attribute specifies the relative path to the `image-1.jpg` file found in the `assets` directory and the `alt` attribute describes the image.

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![The portfolio page features headings in blue text, rounded corners on the image placeholder, and various background colors.](./assets/image-1.png)

  ---

  ## 💡 Hints

  Why is it important that each global attribute is given a unique name?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What other attributes can be used with HTML elements?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 7. Instructor Review: Attributes (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with attributes? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `class`

  * ✔️ `id`

  * ✔️ `src`

* Open `08-Stu_Attributes/Solved/index.html` in your browser and explain the following:

  * We add global attributes to the HTML elements to allow them to be styled with CSS.

* Open `08-Stu_Attributes/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We assign all `<section>` elements a class attribute with the value of `lesson`:

    ```html
    <section class="lesson">
    ```

  * 🔑 We use a global `id` attribute to add a unique identifier to the email list item:

    ```html
    <li id="email"><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="#">someplace@gmail.com</a></li>
    ```

  * We use a global `id` attribute to add a unique identifier to the GitHub list item:

    ```html
    <li id="github"><strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href="#">sampleName</a></li>
    ```

  * We use a global `id` attribute to add a unique identifier to the portfolio list item:

    ```html
    <li id="portfolio"><strong>Portfolio:</strong> <a href="#">coming soon</a></li>
    ```
    
  * 🔑 We changed the value of the `src` attribute for the image to specify the relative path to the `image-1.jpg` that was in the `assets` directory. We also included a description of the image as the value for the `alt` attribute.

    ```html
    <img
      src="./assets/images/image-1.jpg"
      alt="Placeholder image with text 200 width and 200 height "
    />
    ```

  * Finally, remember to link to the external style sheet using a `<link>` element in the `<head>`. The `href` attribute specifies the relative path. Without this link and the `href` attribute pointing to the right path, the styles will not be displayed!

  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css" />
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we use global attributes to set up the HTML elements to connect with CSS?

  * 🙋 We use `class` and `id` attributes to identify elements that we want to style.

  * ☝️ How do we use the `href` attribute with a `<link>` element to connect the CSS style sheet?

  * 🙋 We use the `href` attribute to specify the relative path to the style sheet.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on HTML attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Color (5 min)

* Open `09-Ins-CSS-Color/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * Color is one key way that web developers can add style and personality to a webpage. We can add color to HTML elements using CSS.

* Open `09-Ins-CSS-Color/index.html` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * We have to set up the HTML before we can write the CSS to add color to the page.

  * 🔑 Like before, we use a `<link>` element inside the `<head>` to link the CSS style sheet to the HTML. Remember, `href` specifies the relative path to the CSS file, and the `rel` attribute defines the relationship:

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css">
    ```

  * As previously explained, we use `class` attributes to identify multiple elements for CSS styling:

      ```html
      <section class="box box-orange">
      ```

  * And we use `id` to select a unique element for styling&mdash;which can be useful if we want to apply certain styling to only one specific element on the page:

    ```html
    <section class="box" id="box-yellow">
    ```

* Open `09-Ins-CSS-Color/assets/style.css` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Again, a style sheet is a list of CSS properties that defines how HTML elements will be displayed.

  * 🔑 Each rule block comprises a selector that indicates the element or elements you want to style and the CSS properties to be applied. The name of the selector will match the name of the `class` or `id` attribute in your HTML. A `.` precedes the name of a class. A `#` precedes the id:

    ```css
    .box {
      width: 200px;
      height: 200px;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We use the `color` CSS property to change the color of the text on a page. We use the `background-color` CSS property to add color to the entire width and height of the element:

    ```css
    .box-blue {
      color: white;
      background-color: #0000ff;
    }
    ```

  * There are numerous ways to specify the colors that we want.

  * 🔑 We can specify a predefined color:

    ```css
    #box-yellow {
      color: purple;
      background-color: yellow;
    };
    ```

  * 🔑 Or we can use a hexadecimal code for a more specific color choice:

    ```css
    .box-orange {
      color: #0000ff;
      background-color: #ffa500;
    }
    ```

   * We can also make comments when writing CSS. To make a comment in CSS, we use the following syntax:

    ```css
    /* Sets the height and width of the section */
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we use CSS to add color to webpages?

  * 🙋 We use the CSS properties `color` and `background-color` to apply colors to the HTML elements. We can specify predefined colors or use hex codes.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `10-Stu_CSS-Color/README.md`.

### 9. Student Do: Color (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `10-Stu_CSS-Color/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 📖 Add Color to HTML Page Using CSS

### 10. BREAK (15 min)

### 11. Instructor Review: Color (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with using CSS to add color to your webpage? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `<link>`

  * ✔️ `color`

  * ✔️ `background-color`

* Open `10-Stu_CSS-Color/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We use a `<link>` element with an `href` attribute that indicates the relative path to connect the CSS to the HTML:

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./assets/css/style.css">
    ```

  * We use `class` attributes to identify groups of elements that we want to style. To apply the style to just one unique element, we can use an `id` attribute:

    ```html
    <section class="lesson" id="section-1">
    ```

* Open `10-Stu_CSS-Color/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We add the CSS property `color` to change the font color of `section-1` to yellow, and we add the `background-color` property to change the background to purple. We can either specify predefined colors or use hex codes:

    ```css
    #section-1 {
      color: #ffff00;
      background-color: #800080;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We want to apply the same styling to `Section 2` and `Section 3`. Using a `class` allows us to write a single rule block and apply it to multiple elements:

    ```css
    .section-blue {
      color: #ffa500;
      background-color: #0000FF;
    }
    ```

  * We use the `color` property to set the text color of the `container` to white. This will set the font color for `Section 4`, `Section 5`, and `Section 6` to white as well because they are nested inside the container. We also set the background color to black:

    ```css
    .container {
      color: white;
      background-color: black;
    }
    ```

* 🔑 By using a unique `id`, we can set the font of `Section 6` to yellow without changing any other elements:

  ```css
  #section-6 {
    color: #ffff00;
  }
  ```

* We also use an `id` attribute to apply styling only to `Section 1`. This will make the background color purple and the text yellow. No other elements will be changed:

  ```css
  #section-1 {
    color: #ffff00;
    background-color: #800080;
  }
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is the difference between `background-color` and `color`?

  * 🙋 We use `background-color` to set the background color of the element. We use `color` to set the font color.

  * ☝️ Why would we want to use a hex code instead of a predefined color?

  * 🙋 Both hex codes and predefined colors will add styling to your elements, but hex codes offer a wider selection of colors&mdash;which can come in handy when you want to customize your design.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Instructor Demo: Units and Font (5 min)

* Open `11-Ins_CSS-units-font/index.html` in your browser and explain the following:

  * We can use CSS to do much more than add color to elements. We can also use it to change the font to help create a custom style.

* Open `11-Ins_CSS-units-font/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * Adding a font style to your webpage can be as simple as adding another CSS property to an existing rule block:

    ```css
    .container {
      font-family: "Lucida Console", Monaco, monospace;
      color: white;
      background-color: black;
    }
    ```

  * You can use the `font-family` CSS property to specify the font style for an element. The first font listed should always be your first choice. If that font is not available, the browser will display the next font listed. Finally, you should always end the `font-family` declaration with a more generic family, like `monospace`, so that the browser can pick a similar font if your choices cannot be rendered:

      ```css
      font-family: "Lucida Console", Monaco, monospace;
      ```

  * The `line-height` property takes a length value, to set the distance between lines of text. We use `px` to represent roughly the width and height of a single dot, or pixel, that can easily be seen by the human eye. One inch equates to roughly 96px:

    ```css
    .section-blue {
      line-height: 100px;
      color: #ffa500;
      background-color: #0000FF;
    }
    ```

  * We can also use `px` to set a font size for the text:

    ```css
    #section-1 {
      font-size: 26px;
      color: #ffff00;
      background-color: #800080;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can we add custom font styles to the webpage?

  * 🙋 We can use `font-family` to set a custom font type and `line-height` to change the amount of space between the text. We can also use `font-size` to make the fonts bigger or smaller.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `12-Stu_CSS-units-font/README.md`.

### 13. Student Do: Units and Font (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `12-Stu_CSS-units-font/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 🐛 CSS Styling Not Applied to HTML Elements

  Work with a partner to resolve the following issues:

  * Users should be able to see styling applied to HTML elements when the page is opened.

  ## Expected Behavior

  * Each section should have a background color of `#fffacd`, and the font family `"Lucida Sans Unicode", "Lucida Grande", sans-serif` should be specified.

  * The `fact-1` paragraph should be bold.

  * The `fact-2` paragraph should have a font size of 24px.

  * The `fact-3` paragraph should have a line height of 50px.

  * The finished page should match the mockup.

  ## Actual Behavior

  When a user opens the page, no styling is visible.

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![Beneath a heading labeled "Fun Facts," subheadings list  topics above paragraphs of different font sizes, all on yellow backgrounds.](./assets/image-1.png)

  ## 💡 Hints

  How can you use the global attributes `id` and `class` with CSS to style elements?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What are some other ways that you can use CSS properties to style text?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 14. Instructor Review: Units and Font (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with units and fonts? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `<link>`

  * ✔️ `font-family`

  * ✔️ `line-height`

  * ✔️ `font-size`

* Open `12-Stu_CSS-units-font/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 For this activity, you were asked to debug a broken webpage where no styles were being displayed&mdash;a common development problem. When this happens, first check that your HTML and CSS are actually linked.

  * Adding a `<link>` element will connect the HTML and CSS and allow the styles to display:

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css">
    ```

  * 🔑 It is also important to check that the styles that you want to use have matching `class` and `id` attributes applied to the HTML elements.

  * We add the missing `id` and `class` attributes on the HTML elements so that the styles can display:

    ```html
    <section class="lesson">
      <h2>Baby Spiders</h2>
      <p id="fact-1">A baby spider is called a spiderling 🕷️.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="lesson">
      <h2>Beds</h2>
      <p id="fact-2">The word "bed" looks like a bed 🛏️.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="lesson">
      <h2>Powerful Squirrels</h2>
      <p id="fact-3">Approximately 10-20% of US power outages 🔌 are caused by squirrels 🐿️.</p>
    </section>
    ```

* Open `12-Stu_CSS-units-font/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * Now that the HTML is properly set up, we can add the styles needed so the font styles are displayed.

  * 🔑 We add a `font-family` property to the `section` rule block, applying this font family to all sections that have the `section` class:

    ```css
    .lesson {
      font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode", "Lucida Grande", sans-serif;
      background-color: #fffacd;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We add a `font-size` property to `fact-2` and set the size to `24px`:

    ```css
    #fact-2 {
      font-size: 24px;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 Finally, we add a `line-height` property to `fact-3` and set the line height to `50px`. That is roughly half an inch:

    ```css
    #fact-3 {
      line-height: 50px;
    }
    ```

* Open `12-Stu_CSS-units-font/Solved/index.html` in the browser and demonstrate the following:

  * To test that the page is now displaying properly and all the styles are allowed, we can open the webpage in the browser.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What should we do first if no styles are displaying on the page?

  * 🙋 We should check that the HTML file and CSS style sheet are properly linked.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on styling text](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 15. Instructor Demo: Selectors (5 min)

* Open `13-Ins_CSS-selectors/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * So far, we have focused on using `class` and `id` to select and style HTML elements. Alternatively, we can use a range of selectors to style the webpage&mdash;for an identical result in the browser.

* Open `13-Ins_CSS-selectors/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * We use a **universal selector** to apply a style to all the elements on a page:

    ```css
    * {
      font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode", "Lucida Grande", sans-serif;
    }
    ```

  * We can also select by the element's tag name, which will apply the styles to all the elements with that name and any elements nested in that element. This approach allows us to apply the same font size to all the paragraphs or determine a uniform height and width for all sections:

    ```css
    section {
      height: 200px;
      width: 300px;
    }

    p {
      font-size: 60px;
      line-height: 200px;
    }
    ```

  * We have already been using **class selectors**! Class selectors select all the elements that have that class attribute attached:

    ```css
    .box-blue {
      color: white;
      background-color: blue;
    }
    ```

  * We have also been using **id selectors**. Id selectors apply a style to a single element:

    ```css
    #box-orange {
      color: blue;
      background-color: orange;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are some ways that we can select and style elements with CSS?

  * 🙋 We can use universal, element, class, and id selectors to select and style elements.

  * ☝️ Why would you pick one selector over another?

  * 🙋 Although selectors do not change how the styles display on the page, we can choose selectors with a purpose in mind. If we want to style all the elements, we can use a universal selector. If we want to style only one specific element, we might choose an id selector.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `14-Stu_CSS-Selectors/README.md`

### 16. Student Do: Selectors (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `14-Stu_CSS-Selectors/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What are pseudo-class selectors?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 17. Instructor Review: Selectors (15 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with selectors? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ Universal selectors

  * ✔️ Element selectors

  * ✔️ Class selectors

  * ✔️ Id selectors

* Open `14-Ins_CSS-selectors/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * For this activity, you were asked to provide comments on existing code, allowing you to solidify your understanding and practice explaining code in plain language.

  * 🔑 For this code snippet, you might write a comment that explains that because this is a universal selector, the font family will be applied to all the elements on the page:

    ```css
    * {
      font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode", "Lucida Grande", sans-serif;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 This element selector applies a background color to the body element:

    ```css
    body {
      background-color: lemonchiffon;
    }
    ```

  * This rule block looks different because there are two selectors. When rule blocks have more than one selector, the styling will apply to all the elements of both selectors. (If code looks unfamiliar, it is a good opportunity to check the documentation.)

    ```css
    header,
    footer {
      width: 100%;
      height: 100px;
      line-height: 100px;
      color: #f0ead6;
      background-color: #191970;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We use a class selector to select all the HTML elements with that class attribute. To specify that the selector is a class selector, we place a `.` in front of the name in the CSS:

    ```css
    .highlighted-text {
      font-weight: bolder;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We use an id selector to select a single element. The style will be applied to that element alone:

    ```css
    #contact-section {
      background-color: #f0ead6;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do selectors help us style code?

  * 🙋 Selectors define the elements to which a set of CSS rules apply. Universal selectors will apply styles to all the elements on the page, while id selectors will style on a single element. We pick the selectors based on the specificity required.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on CSS selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
