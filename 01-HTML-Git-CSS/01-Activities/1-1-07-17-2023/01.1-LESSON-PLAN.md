# 01.1 Weekday Lesson Plan: Introduction to Command Line and Git

## Overview

Today's lesson introduces students to the tools they need to succeed in the course and provides introductory activities to help familiarize students with the classroom environment.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `01-Ins_Command-Line` through `04-Stu_Git`.

* In addition, during the first 70 minutes of class, the university will lead introductory activities and provide important course-specific information to the students.

* Depending on the class size and information provided by the university, the `Everyone Do: Welcome` activity might run long or short of the expected time.

* For that reason, the `Setup and Installation` activity is designed to be flexible. Feel free to use any extra time to help students install the needed tools on their computers. If time is short, invite students with additional questions to attend office hours.

* Remind students that they can always refer to their prework for more detailed instructions on how to install the tools they need for this course. Most of the setup and command-line/Git commands have already been covered in their prework.

* It is recommended that students who use Windows 10 turn off OneDrive so that they can follow the class activities easily. Refer to [Microsoft docs on turning off OneDrive](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/turn-off-disable-or-uninstall-onedrive-f32a17ce-3336-40fe-9c38-6efb09f944b0) for step-by-step instructions.

* Normally, each student will be expected to do a `git pull` of the class repository to have the day's activities ready and open in VS Code. However, for this first class, some students might not have access to the repository yet or know how to use `git pull`, which is introduced during today's activities. For that reason, instruct a TA to post the activity instructions on Slack, and if possible, share the instructions on the screen during the `Student Do` section of each activity.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this module for those who want to further their knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Understand classroom expectations and processes and how to seek out help.

* Apply computational thinking to coding challenges.

* Install the tools needed for classroom success, including VS Code and Slack.

* Implement basic terminal commands, including `cd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, and `ls`.

* Create and clone a remote repository using `git clone`.

* Perform a `git pull` to pull down the day's activities from the class repository prior to each class.

## Class Instruction

### 2. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Open the [Module 01 Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eSjztw5kwQvDxH7DcX8CKF1z-45E2_a7CKh8PkKE3R0/edit?usp=sharing) and follow these prompts on their corresponding slides:

  * **What is computational thinking?**

    * **Computational thinking** is a way of logically breaking down a problem so that we can develop a step-by-step solution.

    * Key principles of computational thinking include the following:

      * Decomposition

      * Pattern recognition

      * Abstraction

      * Algorithms

  * **What is decomposition?**

    * We use **decomposition** to break down a problem down into smaller, more manageable parts.

  * **What is pattern recognition?**

    * Once a problem is broken down, we use **pattern recognition** to find similarities and patterns among the smaller parts. This helps us solve the problem more efficiently.

  * **What is abstraction?**

    * Once patterns are recognized, we use **abstraction** to focus on important and relevant information and filter out what is not needed to solve the problem.

  * **What is an algorithm?**

    * After the other steps are complete, it is time for a plan. An **algorithm** is a set of step-by-step instructions that provide a solution to the problem.

  * **How do we apply computational thinking to solve coding challenges?**

    * User stories and acceptance criteria help us clarify the scope of the problem and break it down into manageable parts.

  * A **user story** helps us identify the end goal and communicate how the solution will meet that goal. A user story follows a specific format: ‚ÄúAs a **[user]**, I want to **[do something]**, so that I can **[realize a reward]**.‚Äù

  * The **[user]** is the end user or customer. The **[do something]** identifies the goal the solution must address. The **[realize a reward]** describes when the goal is met.

  * **Acceptance criteria** provide the conditions that must be met for the goal to be accomplished and the solution accepted by the user. Acceptance criteria define what specific tasks or functions must be done to solve the problem presented in the user story and have a clear pass or fail result. All criteria must pass for the solution to be accepted.

    * **For example:** It's done when there is a contact form that includes a text box for a visitor‚Äôs name and email.

  * The solution is a set of step-by-step instructions that address each of the acceptance criteria and clearly meet the user‚Äôs goal and reward as described in the user story.

* Navigate to `22-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * This week, we will work in groups to build a landing page using HTML and CSS.

  * This is an opportunity to apply computational thinking skills, practice breaking down a coding challenge into more manageable parts, and build the solution step-by-step.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are we building?

  * üôã We are building a landing page that allows visitors to enter their contact information.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What tools can we use to apply computational thinking to this coding challenge?

  * üôã A user story will enable us to identify the user's goal, and acceptance criteria will help us define the criteria that we must meet to reach this goal. Then we can formulate a step-by-step solution that meets the goal.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * üôã This project uses the fundamentals of web design&mdash;HTML and CSS&mdash;as well as the computational thinking skills that we will need to tackle complex coding problems in future development roles.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: Setup and Installation (5 min)

* This section is designed to be flexible. Feel free to use any extra time to help students install the needed tools on their computers. If time is short, invite students with additional questions to attend office hours.

* Explain the following:

  * For this class, we will use a number of tools to write and store code and communicate effectively as a group. To be successful in this course, it is important that we have all these tools installed and know how to effectively use them.

  * You can always refer to your prework for detailed instructions on how to install all the tools and programs you will need for this course.

* Open VS Code and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We use a code editor to write the code locally.

  * VS Code runs on your desktop and comes with built-in support and extensions that allow you to create complex projects in the editor.

  * VS Code can be downloaded free and works on both Windows and macOS.

* Open Slack and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We use Slack to communicate as a class. Look at Slack for important course announcements and information, and use it to communicate with the instructional team and fellow classmates.

  * To use the shared Slack workspace, you must accept the invitation sent to you via email by the university.

  * üîë We also use a Slack app called AskBCS to connect with the Learning Assistant team. To install AskBCS, open the Slack window and click on the plus sign (`+`) next to Apps, near the bottom of the lefthand navigation. Then search for and add AskBCS.

* Open [GitHub](https://github.com/) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We use GitHub to store versions of the code and collaborate with others. In GitHub, projects are stored in repositories.

  * To use GitHub, you will need to set up a free account.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What tools do we use in the classroom to write code and communicate and collaborate with others?

  * üôã We use VS Code, Slack, and GitHub.

* If time allows, break the students into small groups and proceed to `Student Do: Setup and Installation Check`.

* Otherwise, inform the students that if they need help installing any of the tools discussed, they can reach out to a TA or stay for office hours. Then proceed directly to the break.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Setup and Installation Check (20 min)

* During this time, the students will break into small groups to troubleshoot any installation issues and ensure that they have VS Code, Slack, and GitHub running on their machines.

* The instructional team should actively engage with each group and address any issues. If an individual's concerns can't be resolved during the time allotted, recommend that they stay for office hours.

* Resources:

  * [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

  * [Join a Slack Workspace](https://slack.com/help/articles/212675257-Join-a-Slack-workspace)

  * [Signing Up for GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-github)

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 5. BREAK (15 min)

### 6. Instructor Demo: Command Line (5 min)

* Explain that commands are useful ways to navigate quickly and easily between folders, also called **directories**, in the CLI. The commands are entered into the CLI.

* Open your CLI and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We use `ls` to list the contents of the current directory. In the home directory, we see a list of directories, including the `Desktop` directory:

    ```bash
    ls
    ```

  * üîë We use `cd` to change directories. We can change into the `Desktop` directory with the following command:

    ```bash
    cd Desktop
    ```

  * üîë To move back up to the previous directory, we use `cd ..`:

    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```

* Explain that in addition to navigating between files and directories, we can use commands to create and remove directories and files.

  * Let's create a new directory in `Desktop` with a new file.

  * üîë We start by checking the working directory with `pwd` (in other words, "print working directory"). When we use this command to print the working directory, it shows us the path:

    ```bash
    pwd
    ```

  * üîë Because we want to create the new folder inside the `Desktop` directory, we navigate down one layer into the `Desktop` directory, using `cd`:

    ```bash
    cd Desktop
    ```

  * üîë Then we use the `mkdir` command to create a new directory named `demo-folder`:

    ```bash
    mkdir demo-folder
    ```

  * üîë To add a file to the new directory, first we use `cd` to navigate into `demo-folder`:

    ```bash
    cd demo-folder
    ```

  * üîë Then we use `touch` to create a new file called `index.html` inside of `demo-folder`:

    ```bash
    touch index.html
    ```

  * üîë We can use `ls` to check that the new file has been successfully added to the directory:

    ```bash
    ls
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we use command-line commands to change directories?

  * üôã We use `cd` to go down and change to a new directory. We use `cd ..` to go back up to the previous directory.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we use command-line commands to create a new file?

  * üôã We use `touch` and the name of the new file that we want to create.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we use command-line commands to create a new directory?

  * üôã We use `mkdir` and the name of the new directory that we want to create.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Command-Line/README.md`.

### 7. Student Do: Command Line (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Command-Line/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # üìñ Use Command-Line Commands to Create Directory and File

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to use the command line to create a directory and file on my computer.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when a new directory named `first-day` has been created using command-line commands.

  * It's done when the `first-day` directory contains a file named `index.html`. The file should also be created using command-line commands.

  ## üìù Notes

  Refer to the documentation:

  [MDN Web Docs on basic built-in terminal commands](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line#Basic_built-in_terminal_commands)

  ---

  ## üí° Hints

  What command can you use to list the contents of a directory? How can you use this command to check your work?

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * Which command do you use to copy or move files?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 8. Instructor Review: Command Line (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with the command line? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `cd`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `mkdir`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `touch`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `ls`

* Open `02-Stu_Command-Line/README.md` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * The user story helps us to identify the goal and reward. The user, a developer, wants to use only the command line to make a new directory and file:

      ```md
      As a developer, I want to use the command line to create a directory and file on my computer.
      ```

  * We use the acceptance criteria to identify when the user's goal has been met. To meet the stated user goal, we need to create a new directory named `first-day`. Inside that directory, we need to create an `index.html` file:

      ```md
      * It's done when a new directory named `first-day` has been created using command-line commands.

      * It's done when the `first-day` directory contains a file named `index.html`. The file should also be created using command-line commands.
      ```

* Open your CLI and demonstrate the following:

  * The solution breaks down the steps to meet the goal.

  * üîë We use `cd` to navigate to `Desktop`:

    ```bash
    cd Desktop
    ```

  * üîë We use the `mkdir` command to create a new directory inside `Desktop` named `first-day`:

    ```bash
    mkdir first-day
    ```

  * üîë We use `cd` to navigate inside the `first-day` directory that we just created:

    ```bash
    cd first-day
    ```

  * üîë We use `touch` to create a new file named `index.html` inside `first-day`:

    ```bash
    touch index.html
    ```

  * üîë To test that the user's goal has been met, we use `cd ..` to navigate back to the `Desktop` and `ls` to list the contents of `Desktop`:

    ```bash
    cd ..

    ls
    ```

  * The `first-day` directory is listed among the contents of the `Desktop`.

  * To test that a file has been created in the folder, we use `cd` to navigate into the`first-day` directory:

    ```bash
    cd first-day
    ```

  * Then we use `ls` to list the contents of the directory:

    ```bash
    ls
    ```

  * We see that an `index.html` file is located inside the `first-day` directory.

  * The solution addresses all the conditions of the acceptance criteria and clearly meets the user's goal. Good work!

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What command can we use to create a directory in the command line?

  * üôã We use `mkdir` to create a directory.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What command can we use to create a file in the command line?

  * üôã We use `touch` to create a file.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the MDN Web Docs on [basic built-in terminal commands](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line#Basic_built-in_terminal_commands), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Instructor Demo: Git (5 min)

* Explain that developers need to be able to store and manage code as well as share it with others. In this class, we will be using a tool called GitHub for that purpose.

* Open [GitHub](https://github.com/) in your browser and demonstrate the following.

  * In this class, we will share code in repositories using GitHub.

  * Click on the green New button on the top left, or the plus sign `+` on the top right, to create a new repository.

  * üîë Select your profile from the ‚ÄúOwner‚Äù dropdown menu and give the new repository the name `first-day-demo`.

  * üîë We select Public because all of the repositories we create in this course will need to be public to deploy to GitHub Pages and get support from TAs on Challenges. It is possible to host private repositories with GitHub Pro, but a paid account is not necessary for this course.

  * üîë Select the "Add a README file" option to have GitHub create a new `README.md` file when creating the repository.

  * Finally, we click on the "Create repository" button.

  * üîë The remote repository has now been created, but we need to pull down the repository to the local machine.

* Navigate in the browser to the `first-day-demo` repository that we just created, and demonstrate the following:

  * To copy the URL, we click on the Code button and select the HTTPS option (or the SSH option if students have completed their prework and have set it up).

* Open your CLI and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë Use the command `cd` to navigate to the directory where we want the repository located. Ideally, you should have a parent directory to store all of your coding projects for this course. For an example, call the parent directory `Bootcamp`:

    ```bash
    cd Bootcamp
    ```

  * üîë We use the Git command `git clone`, followed by the URL copied from GitHub, to clone the repository to the local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <the HTTPS or SSH URL ending in .git>
    ```

  * üîë The `git clone` command creates a new directory with the same name as the repository. We navigate into the new directory using `cd`:

    ```bash
    cd first-day-demo
    ```

  * üîë Let's create an HTML file in the local repository using the `touch` command:

    ```bash
    touch index.html
    ```

  * üîë Before we add the changes to commit them, let's run `git status` to check the status of the repository:

    ```bash
    git status
    ```

  * That will show us which files are being tracked and which are untracked.

  * üîë We use the command `git add` to add the changes. `git add -A` adds any untracked or modified files in the current git repository:

    ```bash
    git add -A
    ```

  * üîë If we run `git status` again, we will see that all of the files are being tracked and are ready to be committed.

  * üîë To commit the changes, we use the command `git commit -m` with a commit message, like "First commit":

    ```bash
    git commit -m "First commit"
    ```

  * üîë To push the changes back up to the repository that we created on GitHub, we use the command `git push`. The `git push` command sends any local commits to a remote location. In this case, the location is `origin` (GitHub), and we want to update the origin's `main` branch. For now, we only have one version of the codebase, called `main` by default:

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

  * Historically, the most common name for the main body of a codebase has been `master`. However, recently `main` has been gaining in popularity. In fact, GitHub now uses `main` as the default name for its repositories&mdash;as do the projects in this course. Be aware that you might see instances of both throughout your development career, or you might hear experienced coders use the term "master branch" out of habit. You'll learn more during the `21-Evr_Git-Guide` activity.

  * üîë It is important that you keep the local repository up to date, especially when collaborating with others. Other collaborators might make changes to the repository that you don't have on your local repository yet.

  * üîë To pull down any changes from the remote repository on GitHub and update the local repository on the local machine, we use the command `git pull`. Just like when we did a `git push`, we use `origin` to represent the original directory&mdash;or more precisely, the original repository's URL&mdash;followed by the name of the branch, which is `main`:

    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```

  * You will be using this `git pull` command before every class to pull down that day's activities from the class repository.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we create a new repository on GitHub and clone it to the local machine?

  * üôã We go to [GitHub](www.github.com) and create a new repository. Then we use `git clone` to clone it to the local machine.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we push changes to a remote repository so that we can see the changes on GitHub?

  * üôã We use `git add -A` to add all the changes. We use `git commit -m` to commit the changes and add a message that explains the changes made. Then, to push the changes, we use `git push origin main`.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Git/README.md`.

### 10. Student Do: Git (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Git/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

    * It's done when I have created a new repository named `first-day-repo` using the GitHub user interface.

    * It's done when I have cloned the `first-day-repo` to my local machine.

    * It's done when I have used command-line commands to navigate into the `first-day-repo` directory.

    * It's done when I have used command-line commands to create an `index.html` file.

    * It's done when I add and commit my changes using Git commands.

    * It's done when I push the changes to the remote repository.
    ```

  * The solution is a step-by-step plan that satisfies the user's goal and ensures that the conditions set out in the acceptance criteria are met.

* Open [GitHub](https://github.com/) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * Click the New button to create a new repository.

  * Select your profile from the ‚ÄúOwner‚Äù dropdown menu and give the new repository the name `first-day-demo`.

  * Select the "Add a README file" option to add a `README.md` file to the new repository that we are creating.

  * Click the Create Repository button.

  * Click the Code button and select the HTTPS or SSH option to copy the URL.

* Open the CLI and demonstrate the following:

  * We use the terminal command `cd` to navigate to the directory where we want the repository located:

      ```bash
      cd Bootcamp
      ```

  * üîë We use the Git command `git clone`, followed by the URL copied from GitHub, to clone the repository to the machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <the HTTPS or SSH URL ending in .git>
    ```

  * We navigate into the new directory using `cd`:

    ```bash
    cd first-day-repo
    ```

  * We add an HTML file to the repository using `touch`:

      ```bash
      touch index.html
      ```

  * We use `git status` to check the status of the files:

    ```bash
    git status
    ```

  * üîë We use `git add` to add the changes:

    ```bash
    git add -A
    ```

  * We use `git status` again to check that the files are being tracked.

  * üîë To commit the changes, we use `git commit -m` and add a commit message:

    ```bash
    git commit -m "First commit"
    ```

  * üîë To push the changes back up to the repository that we created on GitHub, we use `git push`:

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

  * To confirm that we are done, we check that each part of the acceptance criteria is satisfied and that the user's goal is clearly met. When we open [GitHub](https://github.com/), we see a repository called `first-day-repository`. In that repository is a new file called `index.html`. Success!

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are the steps to create a repository using GitHub and then create a local copy?

  * üôã We create the repository in GitHub and then clone it to the local machine using `git clone` so that we get not only the files but also a copy of the history. This will ensure that this local copy is a functional Git repository.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why is it a good habit to use `git status` frequently?

  * üôã When you are dealing with large numbers of files, it is easy to lose track of which files are ready to be committed and which are not. Using `git status` will not only show you which files are being tracked but also which branch you're on. You can then choose which files to stage for commit.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How do we update the repository in GitHub with the local version?

  * üôã We use `git add` to stage the changes and `git commit` to commit the changes. To push the changes to the remote repository, we use `git push`.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [GitHub Docs on creating a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo) and the [GitHub Docs on cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
