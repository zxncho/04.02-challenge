# 01.3 Weekday Lesson Plan: CSS Layout and the Box Model

## Overview

Today's lesson will delve further into CSS. Students will be introduced to the box model and learn how to customize layout using the `display` and `position` properties. Students will also collaborate on a mini-project that reinforces HTML and CSS fundamentals.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `15-Ins_HTML-display` through `22-Stu_Mini-Project`.

* Be ready to view and edit CSS in Chrome DevTools. If you need a quick refresher, refer to the [Google documentation on viewing and changing CSS](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/css).

* During activities, encourage students to rely on the provided user stories and acceptance criteria to identify the user's goal and the conditions that must be met for the solution to be accepted. Doing so will help reinforce their computational thinking skills and set them up for success in future coding challenges.

* For the `Everyone Do: Git` activity, be prepared to demonstrate configuring the local Git default branch to `main` as well as creating a Git repository using `git init`. You might want to review [Git Basics‚ÄîGetting a Git Repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) prior to class, so that you can handle student questions as they arise.

* Help students do a `git pull` of the class repository to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this module for those who want to further their knowledge.

* This module's mini-project builds on the fundamental HTML and CSS concepts that students learned this week. Encourage students to review previous activities for help with syntax and for further study.

* Reassure students that they are not expected to complete the mini-project in the allotted time and instead encourage them to define their own manageable scope of work as a group, while working to complete as much as they can.

* Although students will work on individual projects for the mini-project, they will be put into groups. Encourage them to brainstorm together and share their learnings. This will be the first of many opportunities for students to collaborate and work in groups.

* This mini-project might also be some students' first experience building a development project from scratch. Remind them to break down the project into small, manageable steps and to let both the user story and acceptance criteria guide them to a step-by-step solution.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Set an element as an inline or block element using the CSS `display` property.

* Determine how an element is positioned in an HTML document using the CSS `position` property.

* Identify the box model and its role in web design and layout.

* Configure a local Git default branch.

* Initialize a local repository using `git init`.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Explain that web developers often rely on tools to help troubleshoot issues and build pages faster.

* One of the most powerful development tools is available right in your web browser!

* Open `22-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * Open Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+J (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+J (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS).

  * Tell the students that Chrome DevTools has many useful features for debugging and even experimenting with the code in the browser.

  * Navigate to the Styles tab on the Elements panel and note the CSS listed in the panel.

  * Point the cursor at a CSS property and click to uncheck the box. Note the style change on the webpage.

  * Change the `background-color` property in the body to `purple` to further demonstrate how you can manually change a value.

  * Explain that changing CSS in the browser is a great way to experiment with style properties.

  * You can also check an element's accessibility by simply pointing the cursor at the image.

  * Select the pointer icon and then point at an element on the page. A box should indicate details about the element's accessibility, including the role that it should fulfill (like link, header, or image) to be properly read by an accessibility device. If applicable, a contrast score will also be indicated.

  * Note that having enough contrast between colors helps ensure that your page is viewable to a range of users. Chrome DevTools is an easy way to check whether your page is readable.

  * Encourage students to experiment with Chrome DevTools as they build their own projects later in the class.

### 2. Instructor Demo: Display (5 min)

* Open `15-Ins_HTML-display/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * We use the `display` property to set whether an element behaves as an inline or a block element.

  * üîë **Inline elements** only occupy as much width as needed and do not automatically start a new line.

  * Images and `<a>` elements are examples of inline elements.

  * üîë **Block elements** always start on a new line and occupy as much width as there is available.

  * Paragraph and unordered lists are examples of block elements.

  * We can also use `display` to hide an element.

* Open `15-Ins_HTML-display/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * We use `display: block` to indicate a block element, which will occupy the whole width available:

    ```css
    .display-block {
      display: block;
    }
    ```

  * We use `display: inline` to indicate an inline element, which will only occupy the necessary width:

    ```css
    .display-inline {
      display: inline;
    }
    ```

  * We use `display: none` to completely remove an image so that it does not appear on the page and no longer occupies space in the layout:

    ```css
    .display-none {
      display: none;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the difference between an inline and a block element?

  * üôã An inline element will only occupy as much width as necessary. In contrast, a block element will occupy as much width as there is available.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `16-Stu_HTML-display/README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: Display (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `16-Stu_HTML-display/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # üêõ List Items and Boxes Are Not Displaying Correctly

  Work with a partner to resolve the following issues:

  * Users should be able to see a horizontal navigation bar with three list items side-by-side.

  * Users should be able to see three boxes.

  * Users should be able to see the boxes centered and stacked on top of each other.

  ## Expected Behavior

  * All three list items in the navigation bar should display inline.

  * All three boxes should be visible.

  * Each box should appear centered and on its own line.

  ## Actual Behavior

  * Each list item in the navigation bar displays on its own line.

  * Two boxes are visible, and one is not displayed.

  * The two visible boxes display inline and aligned to the left.

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![Three list items are displayed on the right side of the navigation bar, corresponding with three boxes centered on the page.](./assets/image-1.png)

  ---

  ## üí° Hints

  Which `display` value hides an element?

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What is the CSS `visibility` property? How is it different from the `display` property?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: Display (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with using display? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `display: inline`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `display: block`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `display: none`

* Open `16-Stu_HTML-Display/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * In this activity, we are asked to debug broken code to meet the user's goals&mdash;as stated in the user story&mdash;and ensure that the app behaves as expected.

  * üîë Currently, each list item in the navigation bar displays on its own line. To meet the expected behavior, we set the `display` property to `inline`:

    ```css
    li {
      display: inline;
      ...
    }
    ```

  * The boxes are images that currently display inline. To set them as block elements, we use `display: block`:

    ```css
    img {
      display: block;
      margin: 0 auto;
    }
    ```

  * üîë The third box, `image-3`, is set to `display: none`. This means that the box is not visible and is not taking up space. To make the box visible and match the expected behavior, we use `display: block`:

    ```css
    #image-3 {
      display: block;
    }
    ```

* Open `16-Stu_HTML-Display/index.html` in your browser and explain the following:

  * We open the webpage in the browser to confirm that it now meets the expected behavior!

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How can we use the `display` property to change how an element appears on the page?

  * üôã We can set an element to `display: inline` so that it only occupies as much width as necessary. We can set an element to `display: block` so that it occupies the entire width available. Finally, we can use `display: none` to completely remove an item.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on display](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Box Model (5 min)

* Open `17-Ins_CSS-box-model/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * In HTML, all elements are boxes. We use the **box model** to describe the amount of space that each element will occupy.

  * The innermost layer of the box is the content itself. The content has height and width.

  * The next layer is the **padding** that surrounds the content. We use CSS to set the width of the padding.

  * The **border** surrounds the padding. Like the padding, the width of the border is set by CSS.

  * Finally, the **margin** is the area outside the border.

* Open `17-Ins_CSS-box-model/assets/css/style.css` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * We use CSS to set the width of the padding, border, and margins.

  * The CSS `padding` property sets the width of the padding. In this case, all sides will have a width of 20px:

    ```css
    padding: 20px;
    ```

  * The CSS `border` property sets the width of the border, the type of the border, and the color:

    ```css
    border: 10px solid darkblue;
    ```

  * The CSS `margin` property sets the width of the margin. The margin on each side is 20px here:

    ```css
    margin: 20px;
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are the four components of the box model?

  * üôã The content, padding, border, and margin.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How can the box model help us understand layout and design?

  * üôã The box model explains how much space an element will occupy on a page, which can inform the overall layout and design.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `18-Stu_CSS-box-model/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: Box Model (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `18-Stu_CSS-box-model/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # üìñ Implement CSS Box Model Properties to Design Layout

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to use the CSS box model properties to position four boxes inside a frame.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when each box has a defined `padding` property.

  * It's done when each box has a defined `margin` property.

  * It's done when each box has a defined `border` property.

  * It's done when the finished page matches the mockup.

  ## üìù Notes

  Refer to the documentation:

  [MDN Web Docs on CSS basic box model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model)

  ## üí° Hints

  How can we use the `margin` property to define space between elements?

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What is the CSS `float` property?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 7. Instructor Review: Box Model (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with the box model? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `margin`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `padding`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `border`

* Open `18-Stu_CSS-box-model/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * To meet the acceptance criteria, we must center all four images inside the box.

  * The box has a width of 600px and a height of 600px. For the images to fit inside the box, the total combined space they occupy&mdash;including the content, padding, border, and margin&mdash;will have to be less than that:

    ```css
    section {
      width: 600px;
      height: 600px;
      text-align: center;
      border: 15px solid black;
    }
    ```

  * The width and height of the content is 200px:

    ```css
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    ```

  * üîë First we set the margin on every side to 20px:

    ```css
    margin: 20px;
    ```

  * üîë We set the padding to 20px as well:

    ```css
    padding: 20px;
    ```

  * üîë Finally, we set the width of the border to 9px, make it a solid border, and give it a color of dark blue:

    ```css
    border: 9px solid darkblue;
    ```

* Open `18-Stu_CSS-box-model/Solved/index.html` in your browser and explain the following:

  * The total width of the image is now 20px (left margin) + 9px (border) + 20px (left padding) + 200px (image) + 20px (right padding) + 9px (border) + 20px (right margin)&mdash;for a total of 298px.

  * The total height of the image is also 298px.

  * Because the width of the containing box is 600px and the height is 600px, the boxes fit evenly.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the difference between the padding and margin?

  * üôã The padding is the space between the content and the border. Padding surrounds the content. Margins determine the space surrounding an element. Both are often adjusted to make an element fit in a space.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on the box model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Positioning (5 min)

* Open `19-Ins_CSS-positioning/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * We use the CSS `position` property to set how the element is positioned in a document.

  * The default position is `static`, meaning that the element is positioned based on the normal flow.

  * When an element's position is `relative`, it stays in the normal flow but can be offset by a value provided in the CSS.

  * When an element's position is `absolute`, it is no longer in the normal flow but instead is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor element (as in, element with a position value other than `static`) and is determined by values provided for top, bottom, left, and right.

  * An element in the `fixed` position is also not in the normal flow. However, unlike `absolute`, the position is determined in relation to the viewport.

* Open `19-Ins_CSS-positioning/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We use `position: relative` to set an element to `relative`, and we use the values of `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` to offset the element. Here, we position the element to be 200px from the left:

    ```css
    #relative-box {
      position: relative;
      left: 200px;
    }
    ```

  * üîë To set an element to `absolute`, we first set the parent element to `relative`:

    ```css
    #absolute-section {
      position: relative;
    }
    ```

  * üîë We then use `position: absolute` and use the values of `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` to position the item relative to the parent container. Here, we position the element 50px from the top and 100px from the right inside the container:

    ```css
    #absolute-box {
      position: absolute;
      top: 50px;
      right: 100px;
    }
    ```

  * üîë To set the element to `fixed`, we use `position: fixed`.  Then we use the values of `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` to position the element relative to the viewport. Here, we position the element to be fixed in the bottom-right corner of the screen:

    ```css
    #fixed-box {
      position: fixed;
      bottom: 0;
      right: 0;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How can we use the CSS `position` property to change the layout of the webpage?

  * üôã We use the `position` property to set how an element is positioned in the document, allowing us to move and rearrange elements or even fix them in a certain position relative to the viewport.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `20-Stu_CSS-positioning/README.md`.

### 9. Student Do: Positioning (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `20-Stu_CSS-positioning/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # üèóÔ∏è Implement Absolute and Relative Positioning to Change Layout

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to use the CSS position property to change the layout of my page.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when `box 2` is positioned in the middle of `square 1` using relative positioning.

  * It's done when `box 2` is positioned outside of the upper-right corner of `square 2` using absolute positioning.

  * It's done when the finished page matches the mockup.

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![Box 2 is positioned in the center of Square 1, while in Square 2, Box 2 is positioned outside the square.](./assets/image-1.png)

  ## üí° Hints

  How does the CSS `position` property change the document's normal flow?

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What is the `z-index` property?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 10. BREAK (10 min)

### 11. Instructor Review: Positioning (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with positioning? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `position: relative`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `position: absolute`

* Open `20-Stu_CSS-Positioning/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * In this activity, we need to use absolute and relative positioning to reposition `box 2` in each of the squares.

  * To start, we look at the dimensions of `square 1` and `square 2`, which have a class of `container`. The height is 600px, and the width is 600px:

    ```css
    .container {
      width: 600px;
      height: 600px;
      margin: 20px auto;
      border: 15px solid black;
    }
    ```

  * We can fit three boxes vertically in the square, so we can deduce that the dimensions of the boxes are 200px. This information will be useful in deciding how much to offset the box so that it is positioned in the middle.

  * üîë  To position `box 2` in the middle of `square 1`, we will need to set the position of `relative-box-2` to `relative`. Then we offset it from its original position, 200px to the left&mdash;moving the box to the center of the square:

    ```css
    #relative-box-2 {
      position: relative;
      left: 200px;
    }
    ```

  * To use absolute positioning, we first need to set the parent element to `relative`. Therefore, `square 2` has an additional class of `absolute-container`:

    ```css
    .absolute-container {
      position: relative;
    }
    ```

  * üîë  Then, to move `box 2` outside of `square 2`, we set the position of `absolute-box-2` to `absolute`, and we set the top to 0 and the left to 700px:

    ```css
    #absolute-box-2 {
      position: absolute;
      top: 0;
      left: 700px;
    }
    ```

* If time allows, explain the other CSS using the comments provided.

* Open `20-Stu_CSS-Positioning/Solved/index.html` in your browser and explain the following:

  * When we open the webpage, we see that the acceptance criteria has been met and the webpage matches the mockup.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the difference between absolute and relative positioning?

  * üôã Relative positioning offsets an image relative to its original position but does not change the layout of the other elements around it. Absolute positioning positions the image relative to its nearest positioned ancestor element(as in, element with a position value other than `static`) and removes it from the flow, changing the layout of other elements around it.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `21-Evr_Git-Guide/README.md`.

### 12. Everyone Do: Git (10 min)

* Students have already reviewed the basics of creating a remote repository on GitHub as well as commonly used Git commands. This Git activity will focus on configuring the local Git default branch to `main`, using `git init` to create a local repository, and reviewing the `git pull` command (because they will use it frequently to pull down the class repository before every class).

* Open [Git Basics‚ÄîGetting a Git Repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) in your browser and explain the following:

  * Git is an important tool that allows developers to track and store versions of content. Using a Git repository, we can save different versions of a project's code.

  * Creating a repository is an important part of the development process and should be done each time you start a new project.

  * We can create a repository and use it on a local machine in two ways&mdash;we can create the remote repository on GitHub first and then use `git clone` to clone it onto the local machine, or we can turn a local directory or project and into a Git repository using `git init`.

  * We already covered how to clone a remote repository, so today we will learn how to turn an existing local project into a Git repository.

  * But first we will need to configure the local Git default branch to `main`.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `21-Evr_Git-Guide/README.md`.

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë Before you begin, you need to ensure that the default branch is `main`. If you have not done so yet, follow the instructions in the Git Guide and use `git config` to make that switch. If you have any issues, ask a TA for help or stay for office hours:

    ```bash
    git config --global init.defaultBranch main
    ```

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * Alternatively, we can use `git init` to create a repository. The results will be similar to if we used `git clone`, except that we start by creating a repository locally via the command line.

  * üîë Start by creating a new project directory named `git-init-sample` on your local machine. Ideally, you should store all of your coding projects for this course in a parent directory. Create this project directory inside that parent directory:

    ```bash
    mkdir git-init-sample
    ```

  * We use `cd` to navigate into new project directory and `touch` to add an `index.html` file:

    ```bash
    cd git-init-sample
    touch index.html
    ```

  * To initialize this folder as a Git repository, we will use `git init`&mdash;we need to be in the project folder when we run this command!

    ```bash
    git init
    ```

  * This creates a new subdirectory named `.git` that contains all of the necessary repository files&mdash;a Git repository skeleton.

  * To start version-controlling the existing files in the project, we need to start tracking those files and do an initial commit.

  * First let's run `git status` to check the status of the files:

    ```bash
    git status
    ```

  * We should see that `index.html` is currently untracked. Let's add that file to be tracked:

    ```bash
    git add -A
    ```

  * Now if we run `git status` again, we should see that the file is being tracked and is ready to be committed:

    ```bash
    git commit -m "initial commit"
    ```

  * üîë Using `git init` adds version control locally to a project, but it doesn't create a remote repository. Let's do that now.

* Open [GitHub](https://github.com/) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * Click on the New button to create a new repository.

  * Select your user from the "Owner" dropdown and enter the same name as the local repository, `git-init-sample`.

  * üîë Do not check any of the boxes, because we are importing an existing repository!

  * Click the Create Repository button.

  * Copy the code under the header "‚Ä¶or push an existing repository from the command line".

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * Back in your project directory, paste the commands copied from GitHub. This will sync your local repository with the repository that you just created on GitHub.

* Open the `git-init-sample` repository on GitHub in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * The repository has been updated on GitHub!

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * You will need to pull down the class repository before each class in this course to have that day's activities ready.

  * To perform a `git pull`, first navigate to the project directory using `cd`:

    ```bash
    cd git-init-sample
    ```

  * Next, use `git pull` to pull down the changes from the remote. Just like when we did a `git push`, we use `origin` to represent the original directory&mdash;or more precisely, the original repository's URL&mdash;followed by the name of the branch, which is `main`:

    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```

  * You can view any changes by opening the project directory in VS Code.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 13. Instructor Demo: Mini-Project (5 min)

* Open `22-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * Each mini-project is an opportunity for you to implement what you learned in that module and work with a group to create an application in class.

  * Reassure students that they are not expected to complete the project in the allotted time and instead encourage them to define their own manageable scope of work as a group, while working to complete as much as they can.

  * üîë For the first mini-project, you will be creating a landing page using HTML and CSS. Each of you will work on your own landing page. However, you will still be put into groups so that you can brainstorm and work together through the specifications of the mini-project.

  * üîë The landing page will have a contact form.

  * üîë The landing page will have a header, footer, and an image.

  * üîë The landing page should also use semantic HTML and be accessible.

  * Be creative! You can choose your own colors, text, and image.

  * üîë You might need to do a bit of research on your own! As in real life, you will not always be given everything you need to complete a task. Developers have to be able to research and find their own answers.

  * When you approach a complex coding problem like this, break down the challenge into manageable chunks. Work with your group to figure out the steps to complete this mini-project.

  * üîë You should also refer frequently to the user story and acceptance criteria. Checking your work against the goal stated in the user story and the conditions established in the acceptance criteria is a great way to stay on track.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã We will use HTML to build the structure and use CSS to style the page.

* Answer any questions before allowing students to start the mini-project.

### 14. Student Do: Mini-Project (45 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_Mini-Project/README.md`.

* Break your students into groups that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # Module 01 Mini-Project: Landing Page

  In this mini-project, you will build a landing page using HTML and CSS. While you will be responsible for your own landing page, you will work in a group to brainstorm and share ideas.

  ## User Story

  Work in your group to implement the following user stories:

  * As a client, I want to view a single webpage that collects a visitor's contact information.

  * As a client, I want the landing page to have a header and footer.

  * As a client, I want the landing page to have an image with a caption.

  * As a client, I want the landing page to have a contact form.

  * As a client, I want the landing page to have a polished and accessible UI.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when the page uses semantic HTML elements.

  * It's done when the page uses universal, element, and class selectors in CSS.

  * It's done when the page features at least three colors in the design.

  * It's done when the page uses a single font and font family for all text.

  * It's done when the page uses at least two heading elements (`<h1>` through `<h6>`).

  * It's done when the header is fixed to the top of the page on scroll.

  * It's done when the header contains a navigation bar with three links that display inline, including a contact link.

  * It's done when, if the contact link is clicked, the page jumps directly to the contact form.

  * It's done when the contact form includes `input` elements for name and email.

  * It's done when the contact form includes a Send button.

  * It's done when the image includes a descriptive `alt` attribute.

  * It's done when the page is deployed to GitHub Pages.

  ## üí° Notes

  Follow these instructions to deploy your project to GitHub Pages:

  1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.

  2. When you're ready to deploy, use the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.

  3. Navigate to your GitHub repository in the browser and then select the Settings tab on the right side of the page.

  4. On the Settings page, select Pages on the left side of the page. On the GitHub Pages screen, choose `main` in the dropdown under Branch. Click the Save button.

  5. Navigate to <your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name> and you will find that your new webpage has gone live! For example, if your GitHub username is "lernantino" and the project is "css-demo-site", then your URL would be <lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>.

  > **Important**: It might take a few minutes for GitHub pages to display your site correctly. If your project does not deploy or display correctly, check that all file paths in your application are relative and use the right casing. GitHub is case-sensitive, an incorrect capital or lowercase letter could cause problems in deployment.

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your group to further your knowledge:

  * How can CSS be used to apply a different style to an `<a>` element when a cursor points at it?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 15. Instructor Review: Mini-Project  (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with this mini-project? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Semantic HTML

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `alt` attribute

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `display: inline`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `position: fixed`

* Open `22-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * Everyone's landing pages will look different, so don't worry if yours doesn't look exactly like what we are about to review. As long as your landing page fulfills all of the specifications of the project, you did great!

  * We use `<link>` to link the HTML page to the CSS. The `<link>` is placed in the `<head>` and uses an `href` attribute to set the relative path to the CSS style sheet:

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./assets/css/style.css/">
    ```

  * üîë We use semantic HTML to define the header and an unordered list to create a list of links:

    ```html
    <header>
      <nav class="text-right">
        <ul>
          <li> <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a></li>
          <li> <a href="#">Portfolio</a></li>
          <li> <a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </header>
    ```

  * We use a `<h1>` section heading for the title:

    ```html
    <h1 class="text-center">My New Website</h1>
    ```

  * üîë We use a `<figure>` element to add an image and a caption. We use an `alt` attribute to describe the image:

    ```html
    <figure>
        <img src="./assets/images/image-1.png" alt="Graphic with Coming Soon text">
        <figcaption class="text-center">Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    ```

  * We use semantic HTML to define a section for the contact form. Inside the `<section>`, we add a sub-header. For accessibility, it is important that the section headings are organized in descending order. So because we used `<h1>` previously, we use `<h2>` now:

    ```html
    <section id="contact">
        <h2 class="text-center">Contact Me</h2>
    ```

  * You probably had to research how to create a form. A Google search can help you quickly learn how to use an unfamiliar element in your webpage:

    ```html
    <form>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <label class="text-right" for="name">Name:</label>
          <input type="text" id="name" name="user-name">
        </li>
        <li>
          <label class="text-right" for="email">Email:</label>
          <input type="text" id="email" name="user-email">
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="text-center">
        <button type="submit">SEND</button>
      </div>
    </form>
    ```

  * Finally, we added a footer with a `class` attribute used for styling:

    ```html
    <footer class="text-center">
      ¬© 2023 My New Website Productions
    </footer>
    ```

* Open `22-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We use a universal selector to set the margin and padding of all elements to 0:

    ```css
    * {
      margin:0;
      padding:0;
    }
    ```

  * üîë We use an element selector to select all the list items and set the display property to `inline`. This will create a horizontal set of links in the navbar:

    ```css
    li {
      display: inline;
      padding: 0px 20px;
      text-decoration: none;
    }
    ```

  * üîë To keep the header fixed to the top of the viewport, we set the position to `fixed`:

    ```css
    header {
      position: fixed;
      border-bottom: 10px solid #DDAF94;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why is it important to design webpages with accessibility in mind?

  * üôã Making your website accessible to more people can result in more users!

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on structuring the web with HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML) and the [MDN Web Docs on learning to style HTML using CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 16. Instructor Demo: Introduce Challenge (5 min)

* Open `02-Challenge/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * During this week's challenge, you will use your new HTML and CSS skills to ensure that an existing website is accessible using the provided guidelines.

  * Accessibility is an increasingly important consideration in web design. Inclusive design aims to ensure that all users&mdash;including those with disabilities&mdash;can interact with and understand a webpage's content.

  * During this week's activities, we had a brief introduction to the use of semantic HTML and accessibility concerns. This project will require you to do some research to ensure that the goal stated in the user story and each part of the acceptance criteria is fully addressed.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are we learning?

  * üôã We are learning to use HTML and CSS to build a website that is accessible to all users.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

  * üôã We will use new skills in HTML and CSS to refactor an existing webpage and build off of the accessibility concepts covered in class.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * üôã Developers need to be able to design websites with all users in mind so that they can create inclusive user experiences and attract more users to various projects.

* Ask TAs to direct students to the Challenge Requirements found in `02-Challenge/README.md`.

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
