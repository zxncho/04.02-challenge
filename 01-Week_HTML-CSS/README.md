# Module 01 Instructor Overview: HTML, CSS, and Git

## Overview

In this module, you will introduce students to HTML, CSS, and version control with Git.

Review this module's Roadmap in Canvas for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and this module's Challenge.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* **Important**: Students will receive access to the GitHub Student Developer Pack in Week 8 of the course through an email invitation at the email address they have on file with the boot camp. The Developer Pack provides them with $13 in free Heroku credits each month, which they'll need to complete several of the Challenge assignments and projects in the second half of the course.

  * To ensure that your students receive this invitation and that it doesn't get sent to spam, please ask them to add `fs-ground_bootcamp@edx.org` to the their list of contacts with the email address they have on file with the boot camp.

  * If students need guidance on how to add a contact to their contacts, please provide them with the links below:

* During the first 70 minutes of the first class, the university will lead introductory activities and provide important course-specific information to the students.

* Also during the first class, you will review the tools that students will need in this course, including Slack, VS Code, and GitHub. Refer to the [Slack workspace set-up guide](https://slack.com/help/articles/212675257-Join-a-Slack-workspace), the [VS Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), and the [GitHub Docs on setting up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git) to review set-up and installation on both Windows and Mac machines.

* Remind students that they can always refer to their prework for more detailed installation instructions. However, if a student is struggling to install or use the required tools, encourage them to stay for office hours for additional help.

* In addition to HTML, CSS, and Git fundamentals, the activities for this week also aim to familiarize students with classroom expectations. Make sure to emphasize the importance of doing a `git pull` of the class repo before each class.

* For the `Everyone Do: Git` activity, be prepared to demonstrate configuring the local Git default branch to `main` as well as creating a Git repository using `git init`. You might want to review [Git Basicsâ€”Getting a Git Repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) ahead of time to prepare for student questions that might arise.

* The mini-project is intentionally designed to help students gain experience applying the skills they have learned in the moduleâ€™s activities while challenging them to work on a real-world application in a collaborative setting. It's also designed to allow our students to solve problems before being presented with a solution, a learning science concept known as the generation effect. The generation effect is a phenomenon where information is better remembered if it is generated from one's own mind rather than simply read. When students are asked to solve something they've never seen before, they pull in related knowledge they already have to fill in the gaps in their understanding, and then make a stronger connection between this new solution and the knowledge they already had. For more information, please read the [wiki post on Mini-Project Expectations](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/fullstack-ground/wiki/Mini-Project-Expectations).

* Reassure students that they are not expected to complete the project in the allotted time and instead encourage them to define their own manageable scope of work as a group, while working to complete as much as they can. In addition, please use the `Instructor Review: Mini-project` time to go over the mini-project's key points. Finally, encourage students to compare their progress when working on the mini-project to the solution code they receive, so that they can reverse engineer the solution to better understand it on their own.

* This module's mini-project builds on the fundamental HTML and CSS concepts covered this week. Students will each work on their own projects, but they will be put into groups so that they can brainstorm together and share their learnings. This will be the first of many opportunities for them to collaborate in groups.

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related career services material can be found in the Weekly Wrap-Up in Canvas.

* If you'd like more information on career services, visit the [career services resources page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp/).

## Heads-Up

In the next module, students will build on CSS and other fundamentals as they delve into responsive web design and advanced CSS.
