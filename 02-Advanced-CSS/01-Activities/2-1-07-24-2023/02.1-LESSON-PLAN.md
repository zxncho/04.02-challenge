# 02.1 Weekday Lesson Plan: Responsive Design

## Overview 

In today's class, students will implement media queries and flexbox to create a responsive web design. Students will also experiment with styling CSS boxes.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `01-Ins_Media-Query-Screen` through `10-Stu_Box-Styling`.

* The activities in this module use `max-width` over `min-width` for media query breakpoints. This is because it's simpler to introduce responsive breakpoints with a desktop-first approach. 

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* When reviewing activities, ask for volunteers to share their solutions or to walk through the solution line by line.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this module, for those who want to further their knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to do the following:

* Implement basic media queries for screens.

* Implement a CSS grid to accomplish a complex layout.

* Implement a flexbox layout for a responsive web design.

* Use flexbox justification and alignment properties for spacing.

* Enhance the UI of a webpage using box styling.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Open the [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rT5yNgE7-lTjmLAqPsNJkTTkR_NPQcxZnn9NII1JSuM/edit?usp=sharing) and follow these prompts on their corresponding slides:

  * **Advanced CSS**: This module is all about deepening our knowledge of CSS in order to build attractive, responsive UIs for our applications.

  * **Why do we use CSS?** CSS allows us to make plain HTML content in our applications look clean and presentable to users.

  * **What are some features of a well-designed app?**
  
    * Well-designed apps should have a mobile-responsive layout, good use of color contrast and space, readable font sizes, accessible design, and features that enhance the user's experience.

  * **What is our role in implementing these features?**
  
    * We are not graphic designers, but as web developers, it is our job to build a user interface that is usable and visually appealing to the app's target audience. 
  
    * We need to make sure that our app follows accessibility standards, performs well on both mobile and desktop devices, and is easy to maintain.

  * **Can we build well-designed apps with CSS?** 
  
    * Yes, we can! Browsers are constantly adding support for more CSS-based tools that we can use.
    
    * Those tools include flexbox and grid for responsive layouts, transitions for animating the user interface, new units of size for developers to use, image color filtering, and more!

  * **How can we learn to build these features?** 
  
    * CSS is a unique language, as it gives the developer many options for how to accomplish a goal. The best way to build CSS knowledge is to build apps and experiment with what does or doesn't work! 
    
    * Try some of the following techniques to learn CSS:
    
      * Read the official documentation and practice with the provided examples.
      
      * Reverse-engineer finished code to see how it was created.
      
      * Build something from scratch.
      
      * Debug a broken app using Chrome DevTools.
    
      * And most importantly, ask questions!

  * In this module, we will learn how to build responsive web designs, perform a CSS reset, and implement CSS custom properties and selectors.

  * Let's take a quick look at the mini-project that we will complete at the end of this module.

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/index.html` in your browser and open Chrome DevTools to demonstrate simulating a mobile viewport.

  * To access the Chrome DevTools, we can press Cmd+Opt+I on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+I on Windows.

  * We can enable the device emulator by clicking the "Toggle device toolbar" icon in the top-left.

  * We can select Responsive and drag the edges of the screen to any size we want. Or we can choose from the drop-down list of popular devices.

  * üîë We are viewing the mini-project that we will be able to build by the end of this module.

  * üîë The mini-project is a webpage that holds a collection of CSS snippets that we learned throughout this module. It's like a CSS cheat sheet!

  * üîë Notice what happens to the layout when we change the screen size. The columns shift and stack as the screen gets smaller. This is called **responsive web design**. This is accomplished by using media queries and flexbox, which we will cover today.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What are we learning?

    * üôã We are deepening our knowledge of CSS and learning about responsive web design.

    * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project build on or extend previously learned material?

    * üôã We are continuing to build on our knowledge of HTML and CSS.

    * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project relate to your career goals?

    * üôã Learning more advanced CSS with attractive layouts creates webpages that stand out. Responsive web design is crucial because users increasingly access webpages from devices with varying screen sizes, resolutions, and orientations. To maintain a good user experience, developers must be able to design webpages that are attractive and accessible from any platform.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 2. Instructor Demo: Media Query for Screen (5 min) 

* Open `01-Ins_Media-Query-Screen/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We see a dark-blue header, a dark-tan navbar, a green sidebar, and a white body section. We also see white image placeholders. 

  * üîë When we open Chrome DevTools and start shrinking the screen size, these components change colors! 

  * üîë First, the header will change to a deep-red color when the screen size gets to 992px. Then, the navbar will change to a dark-pink color when the screen size gets to 768px. Finally, the image placeholders will change to a blue color when the screen size gets to 576px or smaller.

  * This is all made possible by using media queries.

* Open `01-Ins_Media-Query-Screen/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * When we use `max-width` as the breakpoint, we need to go from widest to narrowest to avoid any conflicts.

  * We use `@media screen` and then set the breakpoint using `max-width`:

    ```css
    @media screen and (max-width: 992px) 
    ```

  * Then we set the styles that will change at that breakpoint. For us, it was changing the header color:

    ```css
    @media screen and (max-width: 992px) {
      header {
        background: #772014;
      }
    }
    ```

  * For the breakpoint of 768px, we changed the navbar color:

    ```css
    @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
      nav {
        background-color: #bb8588;
      }
    }
    ```

  * For the breakpoint of 576px, we changed the image placeholders' colors:

    ```cs
    @media screen and (max-width: 576px) {
      .sample-img {
        background-color: #8ac4ff;
      }
    }
    ```

  * Of course, we can change more than just the background colors when the screen size gets smaller. Do you remember what the layout of the page looked like when we shrank that screen size earlier?

* Go back to the `index.html` in the browser and demonstrate how squished the layout looks.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è If there's a `max-width`, is there also a `min-width`?

  * üôã Yes! Ultimately, you'd want to use `min-width` and design for a "mobile-first" approach, but it's easier to learn media queries taking a "desktop-first" approach and using `max-width` instead. Although we use `max-width` here, you'll likely see `min-width` used in some future activities as well.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build the next activity?

  * üôã We would need to use media queries to change the width of the components so that they stack on top of each other when the screen size gets smaller.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Media-Query-Screen/README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: Media Query for Screen (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Media-Query-Screen/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # üèóÔ∏è Implement Media Queries for Screens

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As an online shopper, I want to view products clearly on my mobile phone as well as my computer.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when the screen size is larger than 992px and the product cards on the screen are side by side.

  * It's done when I change the screen size to 992px or smaller, and the product cards on the screen split into two columns.

  * It's done when I change the screen size to 768px or smaller, and the product cards on the screen become stacked on top of each other.

  * Optional: Just for fun, change the background color of the header each time the product cards change layout. 

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance at 992px or smaller:

  ![On an online store's webpage, four cards are split into two rows and two columns.](./Images/01-product-columns.png)

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance at 768px or smaller:

  ![On an online store's webpage, two cards are stacked on top of each other.](./Images/02-products-stacked.png)

  ## üí° Hints

  * What is the media feature we use to check for the maximum width of the display area?

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:

  * What is mobile-first design?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* When breaking everyone into groups, remind students and TAs that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be addressed. It's a good way for your team to encourage and prioritize students who need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: Media Query for Screen (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with media queries for screen? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points (‚úîÔ∏è):

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `@media screen`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `width` of cards

* Open `02-Stu_Media-Query-Screen/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We are given an online store webpage with product cards. When the screen size gets smaller, the product cards shift so that they are clearly viewable on a smaller screen.

  * The cards lie side by side in a row. If we look at the following code, for when the screen size is larger than 992px wide, we see that the cards have a width of 25%, because there are four cards:

    ```css
    .card {
      width: 25%;
    }
    ```

  * üîë But as the screen gets smaller, we need to have the cards stacked. So first, we use a media query with a breakpoint of 992px:

    ```css
    @media screen and (max-width: 992px)
    ```

  * üîë Then we give the cards a `width` of 50%, shown in the following example, which will cause half of the cards to stack beneath the other half:

    ```css
    @media screen and (max-width: 992px) {
      .card {
        width: 50%;
      }
    }
    ```

  * For the breakpoint of 768px, we set the card width to 100%, which will cause the cards to stack in a single column:

    ```css
    @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
      .card {
        width: 100%;
      }
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is a more efficient way to control the layout of a webpage?

  * üôã We can use flexbox, which we'll cover in the next activity!

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Flexbox Layout (5 min) 

* Open `03-Ins_Flexbox-Layout/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We see a simple header on top with four cards in the body section. The cards consist of just a header. But we see that the Camera card is larger than the rest.

* Open `03-Ins_Flexbox-Layout/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * üîë To create a flex container, we set the value of the `display` property to `flex`:

    ```css
    main {
      display: flex;
      flex-wrap: wrap;
      margin-top: 2%;
    }
    ```

  * üîë To force elements to the next line if they don't fit, we set the value of the`flex-wrap` property to `wrap`:

    ```css
    main {
      display: flex;
      flex-wrap: wrap;
      margin-top: 2%;
    }
    ```

  * üîë To align the items and distribute the empty space between the child elements of the flex container, we use `justify-content`. There are different values we can assign, like `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-around`, `space-evenly`, and `space-between` which is what we've used in the following example:

    ```css
    .main-header {
      display: flex;
      justify-content: space-between;
    }
    ```

  * üîë When we want to control how the items will grow or shrink according to the available space, we can use the `flex` properties: `flex-grow` and `flex-basis`. Usually we just use the `flex` shorthand to set the three values of those properties in that order:

    ```css
    .card {
      /* A flex-basis of 200px sets the starting width */
      /* A flex-grow value of 1 allows the elements to evenly grow to fill the remaining space */
      flex: 1 0 200px;
    }

    .card.camera {
      /* The child item with `flex-grow: 2` will grow to take up twice as much remaining space as the others. */
      /* The second value, flex-shrink, defines how the element will shrink if it can't fit */
      flex: 2 1 200px;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build the next activity?

  * üôã We will need to use flexbox to implement a grid layout and ensure that all of the items are clearly shown on the page.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Flexbox-Layout/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: Flexbox Layout (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Flexbox-Layout/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # üêõ Product Cards Run Off the Page

  Work with a partner to resolve the following issues:

  * As a user, when products don't fit within one row, I want to see them displayed in two or more rows.

  * As a user, I don't want to scroll horizontally to see additional products.

  ## Expected Behavior

  Product cards that don't fit within the first row should display on the next row.

  ## Actual Behavior

  Product cards run off the page in a single row.

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance:

  ![On an online store's webpage, products are spread over two stacked rows of three cards each.](./Images/01-product-grid.png)

  ---

  ## üí° Hints

  * What additional flexbox properties could help direct the behavior of child elements?

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:

  * By default, flexbox runs in rows, left to right. In what other directions could it run?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 7. Instructor Review: Flexbox Layout (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with flexbox layouts? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points (‚úîÔ∏è):

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `display: flex`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `flex-wrap: wrap`

* Open `04-Stu_Flexbox-Layout/Unsolved/index.html` in your browser and explain the following: 

  * Let's open Chrome DevTools and toggle the device toolbar. When we make the screen smaller, notice what happens to the header and the product cards. The text in the header is squished, and the product cards run off the page! 
  
  * So we know that the broken code that we need to debug and fix is the `.main-header` and the product cards in the `main` container.

* Open `04-Stu_Flexbox-Layout/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * üîë The `main` container and the `.main-header` already have the `display` property set to `flex`:

    ```css
    main {
      display: flex;
    }

    .main-header {
      display: flex;
    }
    ```

  * üîë We just need to set the `flex-wrap` property to `wrap` so that the elements are forced to wrap over to the next line if they don't fit:

    ```css
    main {
      display: flex;
      /* Forces elements to the next line if they don't fit */
      flex-wrap: wrap;
    }

    .main-header {
      display: flex;
      /* Forces elements to the next line if they don't fit */
      flex-wrap: wrap;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è By default, flexbox runs in rows, left to right. Which other directions could it run in?

  * üôã Flexbox can also run from top to bottom in columns!

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Responsive Design (5 min) 

* Open `05-Ins_Responsive-Design/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë The core concept of responsive design is that a webpage should adjust to all devices. In other words, a web app that is created with responsive design in mind will look good and function well no matter what device a user is on.

  * üîë  Not only is responsive design better for the user, but the tools made available to us by CSS can also make development faster. This is because we don't have to write lines and lines of HTML in order to accommodate multiple devices. 

  * Let's open Chrome DevTools and shrink the screen size to see what happens to the page elements.

  * üîë When we get to 780px or smaller, we see that the navbar links stack on top of each other.

  * üîë We have also forced the sidebar to stack below the body instead of on top of it.

* Open `05-Ins_Responsive-Design/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We accomplished this by using media queries and flexbox properties! 
  
  * üîë We gave the `flex-direction` property of both `main` and `nav` a value of `column` so that the elements stack on top of each other:

    ```css
    @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
      main,
      nav {
        flex-direction: column;
      }
    ```

  * üîë We forced the sidebar `aside` to stack below the body by assigning the `order` property a value of `2`:

    ```css
    aside {
      order: 2;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build the next activity?

  * üôã We need to figure out which flexbox properties are being used at each breakpoint so that the layout changes at different screen sizes.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `06-Stu_Responsive-Design/README.md`.

### 9. Student Do: Responsive Design (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `06-Stu_Responsive-Design/README.md`.

* This activity won't require any coding, but instead students will need to reverse-engineer code and figure out what is allowing the layout to change at certain breakpoints. Guiding questions have been provided; students will need to write their answers as comments.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # üìê Add Comments to Implementation of a Responsive Design

  Work with a partner to add comments describing the functionality of the code found in [Unsolved/assets/css/style.css](./Unsolved/assets/css/style.css).

  ---

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:

    * What other CSS property can we use to create responsive layouts?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 10. BREAK (15 min)

### 11. Instructor Review: Responsive Design (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with responsive web design using media queries and flexbox? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points (‚úîÔ∏è):

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `display: flex`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `flex-wrap`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `justify-content`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `flex` shorthand

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `flex-direction`

* Open `06-Stu_Responsive-Design/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * This activity didn't require any coding on our part. Instead we were given a fully functioning webpage, and we had to explain how it works! Through this kind of activity, we can improve our computational thinking skills. 

* Go through each question (üîë) in the `style.css` and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * üîë What happens when we set the `display` property to `flex`, as shown in the following example?

      ```css
    nav {
      display: flex;
    }
    ```

  * üôã The `flex` container becomes flexible! The child items of the container all move into a row and take only as much space as they need to display their contents.

  * üîë What is the `flex-wrap` property?

  * üôã It specifies whether the flex items should wrap or not. The value can be set to `nowrap`, `wrap-reverse`, or `wrap`, like in the following example:

    ```css
    main {
      display: flex;
      flex-wrap: wrap;
    }
    ```

  * üîë What does the `justify-content` property do?

  * üôã It aligns the flex items and distributes the empty space between them. In this activity, we are telling the product cards to be centered:

    ```css
    .products {
      flex: 4;
      display: flex;
      flex-wrap: wrap;
      justify-content: center;
    }
    ```

  * üîë What is the `flex` property a shorthand property for?

  * üôã It is a shorthand property for the `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis` properties&mdash;in that order. In this activity, we are making the product cards not growable and not shrinkable, with an initial length of 400px:

    ```css
    .card {
      flex: 0 0 400px;
    }
    ```

  * üîë What does the `flex-direction` property define?

  * üôã It defines in which direction the container wants to stack its flex items. In this activity, we are telling the main body element and the navbar to stack vertically in a column:

    ```css
    @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
      main,
      nav {
        flex-direction: column;
      }
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What other CSS property can we use to create responsive layouts?

  * üôã We can use the CSS grid layout.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on the CSS Flexible Box Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Instructor Demo: Flexbox Placement (5 min) 

* Open `07-Ins_Flexbox-Placement/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following: 

  * üîë When we change the screen size, the two product cards remain centered at all times.

* Open `07-Ins_Flexbox-Placement/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * üîë We have already set the `display` to `flex` and the `flex-direction` to `row`:

    ```css
    .products {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: row;
    }
    ```

  * üîë Since we set the `flex-direction` to `row`, that becomes our main axis. We use `justify-content: center` to center the items along the main axis, like in the following example:

    ```css
    .products {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: row;
      /* Centers along the main axis determined by flex-direction */
      justify-content: center;
    }
    ```

  * üîë Then we can use `align-items` to center them along the opposite axis (vertically):

    ```css
    .products {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: row;
      /* Centers along the main axis determined by flex-direction */
      justify-content: center;
      /* Centers along the opposite axis */
      align-items: center;
    }
    ```
  
  * üîë Finally, we set the height according to the height of the viewport:

    ```css
    .products {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: row;
      /* Centers along the main axis determined by flex-direction */
      justify-content: center;
      /* Centers along the opposite axis */
      align-items: center;
      /* Uses the height of the viewport */
      height: 100vh;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build the next activity?

  * üôã We will need to use `justify-content` and `align-items` accordingly, to align the child elements correctly.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `08-Stu_Flexbox-Placement/README.md`.

### 13. Student Do: Flexbox Placement (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `08-Stu_Flexbox-Placement/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # üêõ Link and Button Placement is Incorrect

  Work with a partner to resolve the following issues:

  * As a user, I want the navigation links to be on the right side.

  * As a user, I want the slideshow buttons to be sized as smaller icons and centered alongside the image.

  ## Expected Behavior

  The navigation links are aligned to the right. The slideshow buttons are smaller than the image and are centered alongside the image.

  ## Actual Behavior

  The navigation links are aligned to the left. The slideshow buttons extend to the same height as the image.

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance:

  ![The navigation links are aligned to the right, and the slideshow buttons are center aligned.](./Images/01-product-page.png)

  ---

  ## üí° Hints

  * What are some of the other possible values for flexbox's alignment and justification properties?

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:

  * What e-commerce websites can you find that are using flexbox properties to help organize their components and layouts?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 14. Instructor Review: Flexbox Placement (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with flexbox justification and alignment? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points (‚úîÔ∏è):

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `justify-content: flex-end`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `align-items: center`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `align-items: flex-start`

* Open `08-Stu-Flexbox-Placement/Unsolved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following: 

  * We see that the navbar links are on the left, but we need them on the right side.

  * We also see the long slideshow buttons on both sides of the image. We need to make them smaller and centered.

* Open `08-Stu_Flexbox-Placement/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * üîë First we need to align the navbar links to the far right, or on the end of the navbar. We do that by giving the `justify-content` property a value of `flex-end`:

    ```css
    nav {
      display: flex;
      justify-content: flex-end;
    }
    ```

  * üîë Next we need to fix the slideshow buttons. The buttons are child items of `.product-slideshow` so we set that to `align-items: center` to have the buttons centered alongside the image:

    ```css
    .product-slideshow {
      display: flex;
      /* Align the child elements to the center of the parent */
      align-items: center;
    }
    ```

  * üîë Once we do that and compare to the screenshot, we notice that the image is also centered. But we want it to be aligned to the top, so we set the `align-items` property of `.product` to `flex-start` to match the image:

    ```css
    .product {
      display: flex;
      align-items: flex-start;
      width: 90%;
      margin: 1% auto;
    }
    ```

  * Lastly, this isn't something we had to do, but in the media query, notice how the buttons are removed when the screen size gets too small:

    ```css
    @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
      .product-slideshow button {
        /* Removes the slideshow buttons from the document flow */
        display: none;
      }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What was the main axis of this page?

  * üôã The main axis ran top to bottom, which was defined by `flex-direction: column`. 

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on flexbox alignment and justification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox#Alignment_justification_and_distribution_of_free_space_between_items), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 15. Instructor Demo: Box Styling (5 min) 

* Open `09-Ins_Box-Styling/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We can do many things to transform CSS boxes. Let's open Chrome DevTools and explore a few of them.

  * üîë First, we see how we can rotate to the right and left. Positive numbers make it rotate to the right, and negative numbers make it rotate to the left:

    ```css
    .rotate {
      transform: rotate(7deg);
    }

    .rotate {
      transform: rotate(-7deg);
    }
    ```

  * üîë Next, we see how we can stretch them vertically and horizontally. The first number specifies the x-axis scaling value and the second number is the y-axis scaling value. When we change the values, like in the following example, we can see it stretch:

    ```css
    .scale {
      transform: scale(1.5, 1);
    }

    .scale {
      transform: scale(1, 1.5);
    }
    ```

  * üîë Lastly, we can skew them to the right and left. Again, you can test positive and negative values to see it change:

    ```css
    .skew {
      transform: skew(15deg);
    }

    .skew {
      transform: skew(-15deg);
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build the next activity?

  * üôã We will need to research CSS documentation to enhance the UI of the product cards on the online store webpage.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `10-Stu_Box-Styling/README.md`.

### 16. Student Do: Box Styling (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `10-Stu_Box-Styling/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # üìñ Implement Box Styling on Product Cards

  Work with a partner to implement the following user stories:

  * As the store owner, I want to display the product cards with rounded corners.

  * As the store owner, I want to give the product cards a 3D look by dropping a shadow and rotating it slightly.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when the product cards have rounded corners, drop shadows, and a rotated appearance.

  * The solution does not have to look exactly like the image provided. Play around with the properties and have fun!

  ## üìù Notes

  Refer to the following documentation:

  [MDN Web Docs on creating fancy boxes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Howto/create_fancy_boxes)

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance:

  ![The product cards have rounded corners with a shadow and are rotated to the right.](./Images/01-css-box-styling.png)

  ## üí° Hints

  * Look into CSS border and background properties, like `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, and `transform`.

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:

  * What are vendor prefixes, and how are they useful?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 17. Instructor Review: Box Styling (15 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with `CSS box styling`? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points (‚úîÔ∏è):

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `border-radius`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `box-shadow`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `transform: rotate()`

* Open `10-Stu_Box-Styling/Unsolved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * Let's say that we are the store owners and we want to display our products nicely so that they are more appealing to our customers.

  * Right now, the product cards are just rectangular boxes with no styling. Let's change that!

* Open `10-Stu_Box-Styling/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * First we should identify which element we are targeting. All of our product cards have a class of `.card`, so that's where we will add the code:

    ```css
    /* TODO: Add properties to the cards to achieve the required look */
    .card {
      border-style: solid;
      border-width: 1px;
      padding: 10px;
      margin: 20px;
      flex: 0 0 300px;
    }
    ```

  * üîë First, we need to round out the corners by using `border-radius` and giving it a value of `50px`. Your value does not have to match this exactly, just as long as it is rounded! See the following code for an example:

    ```css
    .card {
      border-radius: 50px;
    }
    ```

  * Notice what happens to the header of the card. We need to round those corners out too, but only the top corners, like in the following example:

    ```css
    /* Added border-radius to match the card */
    .card header {
      border-radius: 50px 50px 0px 0px;
    }
    ```

  * üîë Next, we add a `box-shadow` to the cards to give it a 3D look:

    ```css
    .card {
      box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #aaaaaa;
    }
    ```

  * üîë Finally, we rotate the cards slightly to the right:

    ```css
    .card {
      transform: rotate(8deg);
    }
    ```

  * Again, your values for these properties do not have to match the solution exactly. Have fun playing around with it!

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are some other styles we could've tried on these product cards to make them look better?

  * üôã (Answers will vary.) We could have changed the `border-style` to dotted lines or dashes; we could have changed the `border-radius` to `100%` to make it into a circle; or we could have simply changed some colors.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on creating fancy boxes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Howto/create_fancy_boxes), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
