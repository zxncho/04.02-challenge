# 02.3 Weekday Lesson Plan: CSS Selectors and Variables

## Overview 

This lesson is all about exposing students to what's possible with CSS for both the end user and the developer who's writing it. Whereas the previous two lessons primarily focused on essential CSS knowledge, this lesson introduces some other tools and skills that will increase the students' efficacy in building webpages.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `21-Ins_Wireframing` through `28-Stu_Mini-Project`.

* This day is about exposing students to other tools and features available in CSS. They've learned a lot of foundational knowledge that's required in the field, but CSS can also be a lot of fun once they get the hang of it.

* To emphasize that CSS can be fun and interesting, class will begin with a quick introduction to wireframing. Before class, take a few minutes to acclimate yourself to it and perhaps find examples of wireframing tools you can introduce to the students.

* Students may become overwhelmed by how many CSS tools and options there are, so offer support and reiterate often that CSS gets easier through practice and a lot of trial and error!

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this module, for those who want to further their knowledge.

* If the students struggle with the `Everyone Do: Git` activity, walk through it using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they do the activity and do a brief review at the end.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to do the following:

* Create and explain the purpose of a wireframe.

* Use CSS selectors to reference HTML elements in different ways.

* Use CSS variables to keep their code clean.

* Use advanced CSS styling for an enhanced UI.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (5 min)

* Welcome students to class and congratulate them on learning two of the most foundational parts of web development: HTML and CSS.

* Reassure students that learning CSS is not an easy task and that even the world's best developers struggle with it at times. It requires a lot of patience and practice, but it is worth it when you see something come together.

* Open [Wireframe example from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe#/media/File:Profilewireframe.png) in your browser and explain the following:

  * Explain that the image they are looking at is called a **wireframe** and it is a tool developers use to create robust UI/UXs.

  * Wireframes allow us to visualize how our webpages will act and feel before we do any actual coding.

  * Explain that wireframes can be hand-sketched or you can use digital tools like Figma or Framebox.

  * Let students know that it is important to pay particular attention to the location of navigation bars, titles, headers, content, images, buttons, and footers.

  * Explain that there are three main elements to an effective wireframe: information design, navigation design, and interface design.
    
    * Information design: How we place and present information to our users.

    * Navigation design: How the user moves throughout the site and how pages relate to each other.

    * Interface design: How the user interacts with the elements on the page, with a focus on functionality.

  * Let students know that they will get hands-on experience by creating a wireframe for this module's mini-project.

### 2. Instructor Demo: Wireframing (5 min) 

* Open `21-Ins_Wireframing/assets/Images/01-unfinished-wireframe.png` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * This image shows the start of a wireframe for the module's mini-project, with the rows and columns highlighted.

  * üîë When creating a wireframe, we want a way to visually represent our page layout. Using rows and columns is an effective way to guide our decision-making when placing elements on the page.

  * üîë These rows and columns directly translate to containers that we can use when we begin coding the mini-project.

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/index.html` in your browser and explain the following:

  * Here is the final product that we will create today, which you can keep in mind as you work on your wireframe.

  * üîë Pay attention to how elements are placed in relation to each other and try to convey that in the wireframe you create.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why would we want to create a wireframe?

  * üôã A wireframe gives us a blueprint for our UI/UX.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_Wireframing`.

### 3. Student Do: Wireframing (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_Wireframing/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# üèóÔ∏è Create a Wireframe

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to be able to see how my elements will be grouped together so that I can better design my website.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when I have created a wireframe using Google Slides that has the correct elements grouped together based on the web app's columns and rows.

* It is done when I have completed the wireframe of the CSS snippet cheat sheet mini-project.

## Assets

The following image shows a wireframe that depicts the web application's appearance and functionality:

![Example of a finished wireframe for a form.](./Images/01-wireframe-form-completed.png)

1. Navigate to [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/0/?tgif=d) and use the blank template to create a new presentation.

2. Using the tools outlined in the following image, create a wireframe that includes all the elements that you need for the project.

![Google Slide tools outlined in red.](./Images/02-google-slides-tool-highlight.png)

---

## üí° Hints

* How do elements interact with each other when using flexbox?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:

* How might our wireframe look on a mobile device?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: Wireframing (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with wireframes? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points (‚úîÔ∏è):

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Wireframes

  * ‚úîÔ∏è page layout

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Containers

* Open `22-Stu_Wireframing/Solved/assets/Images/01-wireframe-form-completed.png` and explain the following image: 

  * We started with our header and sub-heading already defined which leaves us with the body and footer to complete.

  * üîë The next section is the row which will hold three card elements that will have their own container.

  * Inside of our row we have columns which hold the data being displayed on the cards.

  * üîë The container which holds our column acts similar to our row container but on the opposite axis.

  * Our wireframe may not look pretty but it gives us some great insight on how our website may look and feel.

  * üîë Say we noticed one section of our website is not what we thought or wanted, a wireframe gives us the opportunity to catch this before we begin coding.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Are wireframes supposed to be functional?

  * üôã No, it is a rough draft of the UI/UX.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Wikipedia Page on Website Wireframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: CSS Selectors (5 min) 

* Open `23-Ins_CSS-Selectors` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We can be very specific in how we select certain HTML elements using CSS.

  * üîë There's no difference to the user in how we achieved this result.

* Open `23-Ins_CSS-Selectors/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We can use the `:nth-child()` selector to apply styles to elements based on their order.

  * üîë We can use the adjacent sibling `+` selector to apply styles to elements that come after another specific element.

  * üîë We can use the direct child `>` selector to apply styles to elements that are direct children of an HTML element.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è When would we use these selectors over what we've been using?

  * üôã The answer is that's it's up to you! CSS provides numerous ways to achieve a goal, so it's a matter of knowing what's available to use in certain situations.

* If time permits, visit the [MDN Web Docs on CSS selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors) and walk through how students can find more information on them.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `24-Stu_CSS-Selectors`.

### 6. Student Do: CSS Selectors (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `24-Stu_CSS-Selectors/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # üìñ Implement an Icon for Downloadable Style Sheets

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a user, I want to see an icon next to every `<a>` element that has a link to a downloadable CSS file in its `href` attribute.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when any link to a CSS file displays a üìù emoji after the link text.

  * It's done when the üìù emoji is inserted using only CSS.

  ## üìù Notes

  Refer to the following documentation: 

  [MDN Web Docs on attribute selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors)

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance:

  ![The updated page shows an emoji icon next to each link that takes you to a CSS file.](./Images/01-selector-complete.png)


  ## üí° Hints

  * How can you target a file type by its file extension (i.e., `.css`, `.html`, `.md`, etc.)?

  * How can you use pseudo-elements to accomplish this task?

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:

  * How do selectors affect CSS performance?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 7. Instructor Review: CSS Selectors (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with CSS selectors? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points (‚úîÔ∏è):

  * ‚úîÔ∏è We can select HTML elements by their attributes.

  * ‚úîÔ∏è We can use partial string matching to get results

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Use the examples provided in the documentation to learn whenever possible!

* Open `24-Stu_CSS-Selectors/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * üîë We select specific `<a>` elements based on their `href` attribute value with square bracket notation `[]`:

    ```css
    a[href$='.css']::after {
      content: 'üìù';
      display: inline-block;
      margin-left: 3px;
    }
    ```

  * üîë We use `$=` syntax to match any `href` value that ends with `.css`.

  * We use the `::after` pseudo-element to add an icon to the right of the selected `<a>` element.

  * üîë Understanding the use case for a lot of CSS features usually requires using the examples provided by documentation and making it work for your needs. 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why did we have to set a margin to the left side of the icon?

  * üôã The icon would have been too close to the link text content without it.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs for attribute selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: CSS Variables (5 min) 

* Open `25-Ins_CSS-Variables` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë There's no difference on the page&mdash;everything looks the same!

  * üîë Not every enhancement to your site will be noticeable by your users.

* Open `25-Ins_CSS-Variables/assets/css/style.css` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We can create CSS variables to hold repeated values and reference them instead.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why would creating CSS variables help developers?

  * üôã It's easier to refer to one variable than a repeated value. It also makes it easier to change a color theme!

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `26-Stu_CSS-Variables`.

### 9. Student Do: CSS Variables (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `26-Stu_CSS-Variables/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # üèóÔ∏è Implement CSS Variables in Style Sheet

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to manage CSS values that are used in multiple CSS rules in a more efficient manner.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when any repeated color values are defined once as a CSS variable.

  * It's done when any repeated border radius values are defined once as a CSS variable.

  ## üí° Hints

  * How can we declare CSS variables, also known as CSS custom properties, on the `:root` pseudo-class?

  * How can we use those custom property values instead of using values that are repeated throughout the style sheet such as `#fff`?

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:

  * What does the term DRY mean in web development?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 10. BREAK (10 min)

### 11. Instructor Review: CSS Variables (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with CSS variables? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points (‚úîÔ∏è):

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Adding variables to the global style sheet with the `:root` element

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Reducing the risk of a typo with variables

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Not limited to colors

* Open `26-Stu_CSS-Variables/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We identify where values are repeated throughout the style sheet.

  * üîë Repeating values throughout a style sheet can introduce a lot of errors, so we store them under a named variable:

    ```css
    :root {
      --white: #fff;
      --dark-blue: #13293d;
      --tan: #d8a47f;
      --border-radius: 50px;
    }
    ```

  * üîë By selecting the root HTML element `:root`, we can make these custom CSS properties (variables) available throughout our style sheet.

  * üîë This is great for colors because hex codes are hard to remember, but you can also use it with other values like border radius.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Do we have to use specific names for the variables?

  * üôã No, we don't. As long as we use the `--` syntax, we can call them whatever we need to.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on using CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `27-Evr-Git-Pull-Conflict`.

### 12. Everyone Do: Git Pull and Merge Conflicts (10 min)

* Open the [Git docs on git pull](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull) in your browser and explain the following:

  * Whenever we want to retrieve updated code from the repository in GitHub, we use `git pull` to integrate it into the local codebase.

  * Sometimes, however, the changes we have made and tracked with Git locally and the changed code we're pulling from GitHub don't match up. Because of this, Git doesn't know how to resolve the issue, and it creates what's known as a **merge conflict**.

  * This activity will serve as a guide to help understand merge conflicts and how to fix them. 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `27-Evr-Git-Pull-Conflict`.

* While everyone is working on the activity, be sure to remind students and instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

* Near the end of this activity, make sure students know the following key point:

  * üîë Merge conflicts will happen, especially in a collaborative setting, so there's no need to panic when they arise.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 13. Instructor Demo: Mini-Project (5 min) 

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Main` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë The page adjusts its layout on different screen sizes.

  * üîë When we hover over a CSS snippet card, it glows.

  * üîë When we click on a CSS snippet, the entire block of code is highlighted.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã With all of our new knowledge in CSS!

* Ensure that students know that their result just needs to match in layout and responsiveness, and encourage them to have fun with their design choices. Their design doesn't need to match the solution's design.

* Answer any questions before allowing students to start the mini-project.

### 14. Student Do: Mini-Project (45 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `28-Stu_Mini-Project/README.md`.

* Break your students into groups that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # Module 02 Mini-Project: CSS Snippet Cheat Sheet

  In this activity, you will work with a group to build a webpage that will hold a collection of CSS snippets. What better way to learn CSS than to build a knowledge base of CSS?

  ## Instructions

  The completed application should meet the following criteria:

  * As a user, I can view a collection of labeled CSS snippets in a responsive grid.

  * As a user, I can easily identify these CSS snippets by their headings.

  * As a user, I can highlight a code snippet by clicking on it.

  * As a user, I can view my application on a mobile device as well as a desktop.

  ### Specifications

  * Must use semantic HTML elements and proper indentation.

  * Use CSS variables to maintain clean and reusable values for a color scheme.

  * Use flexbox and media queries to create a responsive grid layout.

  * Each CSS snippet should have a card-like layout with the CSS syntax wrapped in an HTML pre element. For more information, see the [MDN Web Docs on the HTML pre element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/pre).

  * Each CSS snippet can easily be highlighted for copying on click using the CSS user-select property]. For more information, see the [MDN Web Docs on the CSS user-select property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/user-select).

  * Must incorporate a background color using a CSS gradient function. For more information, see the [MDN Web Docs on the CSS linear-gradient function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/linear-gradient).

  * Must incorporate a bit of animation using the CSS transition property. For more information see the [MDN Web Docs on the CSS transition property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition).

  * You and your group can decide which CSS styles and colors you will use to design the application, but the app needs to be a responsive. Use the following images to gain an understanding of how the app should look at different screen sizes, from a layout perspective:

    * At size 992px and above, the app should resemble the following image:

      ![On a desktop, the application displays three CSS code snippets per row.](./Images/01-app-desktop.png)

    * At size 768px and above, the app should resemble the following image:

      ![On a tablet, the application displays two CSS code snippets per row.](./Images/02-app-tablet.png)

    * On mobile devices, anything under 768px, the app should resemble the following image:

      ![On a mobile device, the application displays one CSS code snippet per row.](./Images/03-app-mobile.png)

  ## üí° Hints

  * The HTML `<pre>` element is very literal about spaces and indentation. To gain a better understanding of how to work with it, check out this [article on considerations for styling the <pre> tag](https://css-tricks.com/considerations-styling-pre-tag/).

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  * Set this project up in your own GitHub repositories so that you can deploy and use it for future reference!

  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 15. Instructor Review: Mini-Project  (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel tackling this mini-project? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Use of the `<pre>` tag and monospace font

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Mobile-first responsive layout with flexbox

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Transition and linear-gradient use

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Main` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * üîë The HTML `<pre>` element interprets spaces and returns literally, so the HTML code needs to look a little disjointed.

  * üîë We build a mobile-first style sheet, where the media queries apply to larger screens, not smaller:

    ```css
    /* media query for larger screens */
    @media screen and (min-width: 992px) {
      header {
        width: 75%;
      }

      .card-column {
        flex: 0 0 33.333%;
        max-width: 33.333%;
      }
    }
    ```

  * üîë We can create a gradient effect for the backgrounds using the `linear-gradient()` function:

    ```css
    .code-card pre {
      /* set styles to make it so code wraps in <pre> instead of overflowing */
      white-space: pre-wrap;
      overflow: auto;
      tab-size: 4;
      padding: 1.2rem 1rem;
      color: var(--gin);
      border-radius: 8px;
      /* use linear-gradient() function to create a fading background  */
      background-image: linear-gradient(
        rgba(232, 102, 236, 0.3) 0%,
        rgba(232, 102, 236, 0.6) 100%
      );
      display: flex;
      align-items: center;
    }
    ```

  * üîë We can animate HTML elements on a pseudo-class state using the `transition` property:

    ```css
    .code-card {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      justify-content: flex-start;
      min-height: 100%;
      padding: 2rem;
      color: var(--heliotrope);

      /* outline is like border, but on the outside of the box instead of inside */
      outline: 2px dashed var(--gin);
      outline-offset: -2px;
      transition: all 0.5s ease-in-out;
    }
    ```

  * We create the glowing effect with an inner and outer box shadow:

    ```css
    .code-card:hover,
    .code-card:hover .card-header {
      box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 8px var(--heliotrope), 0 0 15px var(--heliotrope);
    }
    ```

  * We can change the selection color by updating the `::selection` pseudo-element.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What did we use to create the responsive layout?

  * üôã flexbox and media queries.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material and stay for office hours to ask for help, but CSS is best learned through a lot of repeated practice.

* Reassure students that CSS is incredibly difficult for even the best web developers and is not something they should feel discouraged by. It requires a ton of patience and trial and error to become proficient in CSS.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.
